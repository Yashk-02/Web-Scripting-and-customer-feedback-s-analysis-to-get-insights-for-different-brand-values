Guy buys a 2013 used Nissan Leaf a few years ago. Guy loves the car.
Now he finds it is losing power quickly, can't drive far.
To save the battery he tries not to use heat or a/c.
The cost of a new battery would be $13000, more than the car is worth.
He is upset Nissan doesn't have a way to fix the problem, for a more reasonable cost.
It also upsets him that he bought an environmentally friendly car and now there is a battery that is going to get dumped.
Nissans only real solution is to trade it in on a new model.
This is why I prefer tried and true technology!

I know that when I bought the car that the salesman told me Caddy had downgraded the free maintenance from 4 years to 3, so either they made a mistake on my file or Caddy changed the program and didn't tell me. Whatever, that also meant I got a loaner/rental from them, which I wasn't counting on today. Since I didn't know I was entitled to one I didn't ask for a reservation when I made the appointment last week. When I do that they always have a Cadillac of some sort to give me for the day but today I got a Buck Encore GX since I was at their mercy.

I always sort of looked down on the Encore because its styling makes it look tall and stubby. I guess it truly is that, but I have to say I am reasonably impressed with how it drives. The little 1.3L Turbo engine has lots of zip off the line though it runs out of breath pretty quickly when you put your foot down on the highway. Nice room up front and in the cargo bay too, though the rear seat looks a bit tight. I think I'll take it out for a short trip to the grocery store later, its natural environment.

My, my, aren’t we paranoid. I wasn’t talking about you. I was talking about people who are afraid to live life because of the fear they aren’t being environmentally conscious. I’m not advocating being wasteful but do what you want to do if you can afford it. Like buying a car, I’ve never bought a car because it gave good gas mileage. Everything else came before that.

That's what gets me.........it is tall and narrow, doesn't look like it will stay on the road around a sharp bend. I sometimes have the radio or TV on in my office and when they have an Encore commercial they ask ""Alexa, start my car"" or something, and my Alexa comes on and says something like ""I am not able to do that"". It is very annoying!

OTOH, I like the one when she gets a text the Jones's are coming for dinner, she goes and buys four steaks to make for dinner, then she rushes to the door to find out it is only to babysit their kids, and the little girl says ""Where's the pizza"" At least it was cute the first 50 times I saw it.

Very possible. Canada has only 10% of the population and they probably sell many more in proportion in the U.S., because of some states like California. It probably isn't practical to make or ship cheap batteries to Canada for the number of cars affected. Maybe he could try a wreckers.

I agree with ab on this phenomenon. Usually reviewers give a new car a very positive write up. Not sure what their motivation is, maybe so they will be at the top of the list when another new model comes out, maybe to secure their ability to get new models to test, maybe they want new launches to be successful. Maybe there is an initial thrill factor of trying out a new model. I have heard positive reviews for new cars going back to the 60s, and I always take them with a bit of skepticism.

I don’t like those pop-up screens like the one shown above on the new Genesis. It is not recessed to avoid sunlight distortion. It is also very small.

I noticed that they did away with the gear selector in the console making more room for console storage, much like Mercedes and many other makes and models. Everything is electronic when it comes to gear selection anyway.

My best friend is interested in replacing his 2008 Infinity M35X with a G80 lease. I will go with him when he is ready. But I know he won’t like the narrow height on the GPS screen.
You may be right but according to C&D, ""at a time when many carmakers are replacing switches and buttons with vast touch-sensitive black panels, Genesis uses silver-tone knurled knobs and select physical buttons with white accents, creating a light, bright space. The large rotary dial that controls the infotainment system lives in the center console and clicks with satisfying precision as it turns."" The collage bellow shows an example of this. Enjoy!"
22,Oct-25,fintail,"I don't like the tablet/pop up look either. To me it screams ""suddenly it's 2010!"" and isn't a cohesive design. MB doesn't do everything right (had plenty of tablet designs too), but the integrated seamless screen optional on E-class from 2017+ (standard for 2020+) is the best design in the industry IMO.

Same for the column shift. It irks some people, but quickly becomes muscle memory, and just looks right. Really makes the car feel more open, and removes the false pretense of sport with a floor shift (especially those with a boot), this might be a relatively fast car, but it isn't a sports car, let's stop pretending.

I kind of agree. It is too bad they couldn't actually build that screen into the instrument panel, even if they made the screen a bit smaller. It almost looks like a clip board leaning up against a smooth instrument panel behind it. There should be enough leg room I would think, it is a wide console but it is a pretty big car.

I guess the question is really one of do you want a beater convertible for summer days or not? Would you be confident taking it out on a nice summer day (or for that matter, in a snowstorm) or would you be in fear of it stranding you? The money really isn't much either way, and if you replaced it with another beater then you would still have a cash outlay.

As you all know, he had an inoperable malignant brain tumor in the rear of his cerebrum about 5-6 years ago. He underwent proton radiation at Loma Linda Medical Center near Riverside and after 6-8 months of heavy doses, the tumor disappeared.

When we spoke today, he was very guarded about discussing his health with me. He said he doesn’t want people to feel sorry for him or pity him. He had tests done and said he is waiting for results.

All I can say at this time is that I am very scared that the cancer has returned. I hope he levels with me when he gets the results. If it is cancer, I will fly out there immediately. I am praying that God will watch over him and see to it that he is well. 😔

As you all know, he had an inoperable malignant brain tumor in the rear of his cerebrum about 5-6 years ago. He underwent proton radiation at Loma Linda Medical Center near Riverside and after 6-8 months of heavy doses, the tumor disappeared.

When we spoke today, he was very guarded about discussing his health with me. He said he doesn’t want people to feel sorry for him or pity him. He had tests done and said he is waiting for results.

All I can say at this time is that I am very scared that the cancer has returned. I hope he levels with me when he gets the results. If it is cancer, I will fly out there immediately. I am praying that God will watch over him and see to it that he is well. 😔
Praying for positive results Mike.

I kind of agree. It is too bad they couldn't actually build that screen into the instrument panel, even if they made the screen a bit smaller. It almost looks like a clip board leaning up against a smooth instrument panel behind it. There should be enough leg room I would think, it is a wide console but it is a pretty big car.

Snake, I have been a lurker for several years but logged in to respond to your situation. I also had a 2008 Chrysler Sebring Convertible. I was the second owner. I bought it CPO when it was about 3 years old with about 21000 miles. It was a touring model with 2.7 6cyl with leather interior. The maintenances were starting to get expensive. Like with you it was an extra car. What I thought it might need was about what I thought the car was worth. Dealer would have given me $1700 plus tax savings on a trade. I sold it for $1500 last January. It had 120,000 miles. From what I understand it may have needed repairs that I was not aware of as I sold it to a friend of a friend. In case this helps with the decision you are about to make

If so, and you would have to replace it, might as well fix it up and let it take the abuse. If you would not replace it anyway, might as well dump it, get some cash, free up garage or driveway space, and lower insurance.

My new Allstate auto insurance policy took effect yesterday. I noted that there are two additional ways to reduce my premiums every 6 months - by inserting a data device into my car's diagnostic socket or by using a smart phone APP that measures data using GPS as well as the phone's operation while driving. I turned down the first one which is a ""plug-in"" device but I did opt for the ""Drivewise"" APP within the Allstate mobile APP.

This APP, which monitors my driving time, driving speed, sudden braking, use of phone for incoming or outgoing calls during my trips, and time of day that I take each trip, is used by the insurance company to reduce my premium by as much as 8% in the form of cash-back to me - which is significant ($90.00 - $100.00). I get a discount for opting into the program as well. Initially, I felt a bit like ""big brother watching my every driving move"" but, interestingly enough, opting into this program has improved the way in which I drive every day.

I am not a speeder and I keep enough distance between me and the car(s) in front of me so I can safely stop without slamming on the brakes. I drive in the mornings and early afternoons and rarely drive in the evenings or nights which is a plus according to the insurance company. Prior to signing up for this program, I did frequently use Bluetooth for my phone calls while driving, however now I just let the phone ring unless the incoming phone call is from a contact that I need to speak with, which is very rare. I can always return calls if they leave a message.

As for my speed - I used to drive within 5 mph of the speed limit on the Turnpike and I-95, but now I make sure I do not exceed the speed limit. By observing the above more carefully, I can reduce my insurance by close to $200 per year, which is significant. Coupled with the $750 per year savings I am now receiving for my Condo insurance, that's a savings of $950 per year over my previous insurance for both Condo and Auto. Definitely a good decision to go with the changes in my insurance policies.
So now when a dog runs out in front of your car you'll be tempted to just run it over rather than slam the brakes and risk losing your ""discounts"" that are really just pre-paid and overpaid up front so they are giving you your own money back.

I almost bit on that “big brother” device. I thought that particularly for the two cars that sit in storage for winter it would be fun to see what conclusions they would draw on a car doing zero miles per hour for months. I think the thing that killed the deal was a requirement for electronic withdrawal from my checking account. I’m a bit paranoid about that.

Does the device or app track your location too? I wouldn’t like that. I wonder what they’d say if I told them my phone can’t download apps.

The worst test drive I was even on was in a new Prelude. This guy managed to scare the living bejeeses out of me. For those who may not know late model Preludes are incredibly FAST! He blew down the freeway, tailgated people and was in idiot. I finally made him take an off ramp and literally screamed at him to pull over the ""blanking"" car! He did and I told him ""GET OUT"". I planned to leave him standing there in the dark alongside the road but he seemed to know this and made sure he got in before I could lock the door. We drove back to the store in silence. Whe we got on the lot I once again told him GET OUT! He did without a word and got back in his car and drove off. I was shaking for an hour. We all learned that test drives were the worst part of our jobs. I kept people that I didn't trust on a short leash. Newcomers to our country were the worst!
I can tell more on a test drive by driving 0-30 or 30-50 MPH than I can from gassing it on an entrance ramp up to 80 MPH. My test drives are quite tame. I am a “Toucher”...meaning I try to touch everything I can find on a new car to see if it has any “play” and what all the materials feel like. Today, that’s probably not a good thing.

Haven’t done a transport in a few weeks, but when I delivered a car, I would get the chance to touch everything because I wiped it down with disinfectant when I got in, and again, when I delivered it.

The salesman sat in the back(he couldn't drive a stick) while I drove it to a less populated area where the customer could drive it with no traffic congestion to deal with. On the way I took a 90 degree right-hander at about double the advisory speed. The client was impressed but the salesman wasn't belted in and he slid across the back seat and hit the left door with a resounding thump. The client ended up not buying the 335i; she decided instead to buy a new 340i M Sport with three pedals.

I agree with GG about needing that experience with the car. Plenty of info online about performance numbers, so you already know how fast it is. No real need to prove it!
I don’t know about that. Sometimes the feel of the car is important regardless of the published numbers. One reason I always like Mitsubishi engines in a car is that they have a satisfying torque curve that makes them seem faster off the line than the numbers would suggest. Same with certain GM pushrod engines. They just “feel” right.

True, car 'A' may be faster to 60 MPH than car 'B' but car 'B' may be faster to 30 or 40 MPH than car 'A'. Or faster from 30 to 50 MPH and so on. The published numbers only give a partial view on the numbers.

You don't want to shave .5 seconds off your 0 to 60 mph take off speed?
We had manuals for awhile in early retirement. Nowadays they are harder to find. I don't think I would opt for one in retirement these days, too much chance of an inoperative arm, hand, foot, leg, sore neck, sore back, etc., even if just temporary. Not too many chances to enjoy a manual on city streets or crowded highways.

GM pushrods always seemed to have a lot of their throttle response where you first get into it, while other cars respond more gradually. Some of them really gradually, because of overly intrusive traction control (Volvos with the 6-cylinder turbo, anyone?) Different amounts of TC slip make a difference as well... in normal driving 4-cylinder Outback doesn't feel as slow as you expect it to. Just don't look to have any fun driving it harder.

About 10 years ago I drove my office's Ford F-150 (I think it had the smallest of the Triton V8s) and it felt really strong right off the line, but was a total dog once you got to about 20 mph.

I don’t like those pop-up screens like the one shown above on the new Genesis. It is not recessed to avoid sunlight distortion. It is also very small.

I noticed that they did away with the gear selector in the console making more room for console storage, much like Mercedes and many other makes and models. Everything is electronic when it comes to gear selection anyway.

watched an interesting youtube clip yesterday (no clue what channel, some random guy) that was taking a Porsche 996 for a PPI. Interesting to see the level of detail the shop (Porsche experts) went into, and what they knew to look at. Anyway, the interesting part was when they fired up the scan software, and it listed every instance of out of range driving (over red line, and by how many RPMs) the car ever did. Not hiding any secrets there.
It was not an over-rev, the car is designed to allow a no-lift shift.

there is only so much electronics can do. Think of it this way ... you are accelerating and the engine is straining against the transmission, driveline, tires, and physics to move you faster and faster ... you get up to 7k RPMs, then suddenly relieve the engine of that strain while keeping the fuel dumping in ... the engine can't HELP but over-rev. That's just momentum at work there.

I have heard of companies saying we will repair your....whatever under the warranty. Then when they actually look inside they find they can blame it on the user.

One of the reasons I LOVE driving my Prelude. For the most part, I can keep the speed reasonable and still have fun doing it. I think a BRZ or Toyota FR86 would make a great daily driver. People who have them LOVE them, but people who just read specs and reviews think they are too slow & underpowered.
The worst test drive I was even on was in a new Prelude. This guy managed to scare the living bejeeses out of me. For those who may not know late model Preludes are incredibly FAST! He blew down the freeway, tailgated people and was in idiot. I finally made him take an off ramp and literally screamed at him to pull over the ""blanking"" car! He did and I told him ""GET OUT"". I planned to leave him standing there in the dark alongside the road but he seemed to know this and made sure he got in before I could lock the door. We drove back to the store in silence. Whe we got on the lot I once again told him GET OUT! He did without a word and got back in his car and drove off. I was shaking for an hour. We all learned that test drives were the worst part of our jobs. I kept people that I didn't trust on a short leash. Newcomers to our country were the worst!"

I agree. Once is really enough for testing a top speed limiters function before your warranty is out, or at least that's the excuse I recited in my head in case I got pulled over.

I prefer preserving my gas wastage for hard acceleration at lower speeds, rather than blasting through the air at speeds well north of 100 MPH.
Hard acceleration at low speeds is rather boring too. Any fool can floor a gas pedal and go in a straight line. The skill and fun and skill is taking the curves and straightening them out while not leaving your lane.

well, my bike can get a jump on most cars at a light, because people are too busy looking at their phones to notice the light changed. Plus, I don't see a lot of Camrys peeling out when the light changes anyway.
One day for grits and shins we drove around timing traffic 0-40 coming off of stop lights. It typically took 20 seconds or more to get to 40 MPH.

170,Oct-23,abacomike,"My new Allstate auto insurance policy took effect yesterday. I noted that there are two additional ways to reduce my premiums every 6 months - by inserting a data device into my car's diagnostic socket or by using a smart phone APP that measures data using GPS as well as the phone's operation while driving. I turned down the first one which is a ""plug-in"" device but I did opt for the ""Drivewise"" APP within the Allstate mobile APP.

This APP, which monitors my driving time, driving speed, sudden braking, use of phone for incoming or outgoing calls during my trips, and time of day that I take each trip, is used by the insurance company to reduce my premium by as much as 8% in the form of cash-back to me - which is significant ($90.00 - $100.00). I get a discount for opting into the program as well. Initially, I felt a bit like ""big brother watching my every driving move"" but, interestingly enough, opting into this program has improved the way in which I drive every day.

I am not a speeder and I keep enough distance between me and the car(s) in front of me so I can safely stop without slamming on the brakes. I drive in the mornings and early afternoons and rarely drive in the evenings or nights which is a plus according to the insurance company. Prior to signing up for this program, I did frequently use Bluetooth for my phone calls while driving, however now I just let the phone ring unless the incoming phone call is from a contact that I need to speak with, which is very rare. I can always return calls if they leave a message.

As for my speed - I used to drive within 5 mph of the speed limit on the Turnpike and I-95, but now I make sure I do not exceed the speed limit. By observing the above more carefully, I can reduce my insurance by close to $200 per year, which is significant. Coupled with the $750 per year savings I am now receiving for my Condo insurance, that's a savings of $950 per year over my previous insurance for both Condo and Auto. Definitely a good decision to go with the changes in my insurance policies.

The AC Delco beam wiper blades had taken a set in one direction from being parked at the bottom of the windshield always pulled down. I try to push them the other way when I think of it, but the hot sun since the car is parked facing sun in the driveway when it's outside.

Shopped wipers. Liked the RainX Latitude 2 in 1 Water Repellency at Walmart. Checked RainX site to see how they snapped onto my J-hook type arms. Some of the various models don't clearly say how they work on the package. This blade has a cumbersome multi-type attachment that works for maybe 6 different wiper latch on types.

I put them on the next day during a continual rain. The package says to run them on a clean dry windshield for 2 to 3 minutes to activate the RainX water repellent. I did that. For the first trip there was a little smearing as the water was wiped away. Normally I would have cleaned windshield with Dawn dish detergent for that.

But these wipers are quiet! With a capital ""Q."" They clear the droplets caused by the water repellent on the glass and completely dry the area with the swipe.

I say they're better than the AC Delco which is likely made by one of the major manufacturers of wipers. Are these silicone rubber? Is that the difference.

I hope they last a year to cover the high cost, $14.97. Until the AC Delco's I've used for 3 years, I bought inexpensive Walmart wipers and replaced every 6 months.

Police have publicized that they have been aware of and are policing for the people who speed far above the 85%ile during the flu spread. I have seen over the last many weeks that they are policing in areas where the high speeders are most prone to being caught and policing in ways to trap them.

Or some others might feel safer because the lunatics are confined to the two lanes?

Police have publicized that they have been aware of and are policing for the people who speed far above the 85%ile during the flu spread. I have seen over the last many weeks that they are policing in areas where the high speeders are most prone to being caught and policing in ways to trap them.

I've commented that many speeding cars seem to be Chargers and Challengers with other makes thrown in--at least here in the eastern Midwest.
No doubt, in talking to fellow speeders, we all noticed the disappearance of speed related revenue generation the first few weeks of COVID, then someone in power saw the bottom drop out of the incoming revenue streams, and IMMEDIATELY ordered all hands on deck for speed enforcement, Corona Virus or not! It's a tale of two entirely different worlds.

211,Oct-20,ronsteve,"Here in Louisville, the lack of traffic and enforcement during the shutdown back in the spring was taken by many as a license to drive at ludicrous speed. And even after traffic picked back up with the reopening (albeit not to pre-COVID levels) there are still a significant portion of drivers well above posted speed limits. I'd say the 85th percentile speed became more like 60th percentile... And that makes for some nasty closing speeds.

But still, I had to really channel my inner andres3 to even draw the attention of a cop once. Fortunately I stopped channeling him when the officer came to my window. Ended up with a verbal warning when I could have easily ended up with multiple citations.

Now that a lot of people are going back to work or school or wherever they are going they are driving wilder and crazier than ever. Maybe they have covid fatigue and have to let off steam driving like they are in a racing car.

I’m so happy that I never had a mortgage on my house. So many entities trying to carve a piece out of you.
You are not kidding about having a lot of entities with their hands out trying to take a piece of the pie!!!! It's hard to reduce them too!!!

Frankly, as useless as Bank-hired appraisers are (given they are inaccurate constantly) Banks might as well not hire them and everyone saves the money (namely the buyer/seller as they end up paying for it). That was probably the best thing Obama did; HARP 2.0 allowed loans without the wasted time and cost of a hired appraiser.

We would have had PMI on our first house but our lender suggested we take out a small 2nd that covered the difference which we paid off pretty aggressively. I would have never thought about that option. Thankfully, we never had to worry about PMI with our last two houses.
When we sold our house in 1998, the buyer did an 80/10 1st/2nd mortgage with 10% down, to avoid PMI. Smooth move.

Well, I just started two new insurance policies that together saved me about $800 annually on Auto and Condo. Auto is underwritten by Allstate and Condo is underwritten by Castle Key Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate. I went ahead and cancelled the Condo policy effective today because I received a binder from the Agent. I cancelled the Auto policy with Geico effective 10/22/20 which is when the new policy takes effect.

Hopefully I made the right decisions regarding my insurance coverages - only time will tell.

Isn't PMI paid when you don't have 20% or so equity?
I recently found out it is not so simple. I've never personally paid PMI, but when my brother and his girlfriend were in the process of buying my parents' house, they asked me to look over all the paperwork. House appraised at $360k and they were borrowing $175k. Yes, less than 50%. Yet, they are getting charged PMI! I called the broker and he explained that the loan is so tricky because he doesn't have provable income and her credit is so bad, so he had to go with the one lender who would actually take the deal, and they insisted on PMI. It makes NO sense to me whatsoever, but no amount of arguing was making it go away.

We had a young lady on the probation revocation docket- very mouthy, wouldn't listen to her attorney or the judge. She kept saying ""I want to go to REHAB!!!""- never mind she had been sent to several treatment centers and walked away from all of them. I was waiting for an opportunity to speak so I could refer to the girl as ""Ms. Winehouse"", and almost simultaneously I received a text from a defense attorney with a link to the Winehouse song Rehab. I told the attorney what I had been planning and she said that she would have completely lost it if I actually had called the girl ""Winehouse.""

I had another revocation hearing with a notorious attorney that everyone in my area knows- she's the kind of attorney that elicits groans whenever her name is mentioned- lets call her CL(Crazy Lawyer). Anyway, it was a simple revocation, pretty much open and shut- a standard condition of probation is no new criminal convictions- this person had picked up three AND was also running an illegal pull-tab gambling racket on her public FB page(I even had the screenshots). Anyway, I asked my witness(the Probation Officer) at most 5 questions; CL cross examined the PO for maybe 20 minutes, asking all kinds of inane questions. When it was time for closing arguments CL continued on with her obtuse comments. I was all primed to respond with a boatload of caustic and sarcastic comments but the judge ruled for me without giving me an opportunity to respond; I was bummed.

On Wednesdays a lot of the attorneys and the Circuit and District Judges hit a local watering hole to unwind. I told the judge I was disappointed that I wasn't allowed to make a closing argument because I had a lot of sarcastic comments prepared and he laughed and told me that he was certain of that and that's why he didn't give me a chance. I also found out that several people who didn't have cases had signed on to that docket anyway because they had learned that I had a hearing with the Crazy Lawyer and they were hoping for some entertaining fireworks.

1.) I really like Kentucky, probably my favorite state.
2.) I forgot how much I really like caves.
3.) The BMW handled the back roads through the rolling Kentucky hills great.
4.) On the Interstate we were in the mid 30's MPG maintaining a 80 MPH rate through flat Indiana.
5.) Found a restaurant in the middle of nowhere Kentucky where it had no business being. Stopped in for breakfast and they had some great food. The gravy for the biscuits was superb.
6.) Note to wife, take my wallet before letting me into the gift shop of any distillery.
7.) To many distilleries, not enough time.
8.) My drink cart is stocked for the next year.
9.) Downtown Louisville on a Saturday night is like being nowhere at all.
10.) After over a year of ownership my wife just discovered the subtle ambient lighting in the cabin of the BMW on a dark rural interstate in Northern Indiana.
11.) The Nav system in the BMW kept mispronouncing ""Chicago""
12.) The nav system kept telling me ""bear left"", I don't care if the bear left and since it was so concerned about the bear why didn't it tell me when the bear returned?

I got a letter today from an insurance agent up near Daytona Beach, about 200 miles north of where I live. The letter stated that Allstate was writing condo policies again in my area and that he could save me quite a bit of money.

Having nothing to lose, I gave him a call. For an exact policy with the same limits, the premium was $769 for a 12 month policy. That’s a savings of over $700 a year compared to my existing policy. But I had to couple my auto policy with the condo policy. A 6 month premium with the same coverages was $95 less than I am currently paying GEICO. So tomorrow I will cancel my policies and start a new auto and condo policy with the Allstate agency up there near Daytona Beach. But I will make sure he sends me binders for both policies before I cancel the other policies.

Was definitely worth taking a few minutes to check out his agency.

Not sure if I would want it to look like an Audi, but a tuck and trim here and there would be very helpful.

Transport business....really staring to accelerate....to the point where I would need help. My “back up” guy doesn’t want to work the hours it would take, especially with me out of commission for a while. So, it’s looking like the short lived little business I was building to have something to do during retirement is going to disappear....especially in light of my current situation.

Current situation....went for the 10 day follow up to my detached retinal surgery. Well...none of it is good news. It appears the retina is detaching again. Surgeon was hopeful initially. But, I now have to go back for another surgery tomorrow, this time putting oil behind the retina to hold in place (sturdier than the gas they injected before). Oil has to be removed at some point (few-6 months). So, that’s yet another eye surgery. That’ll be 7 surgeries, all on the same eye. 50-50 I get sight back. I’m almost OK with no sight in that eye if the surgeries will cease.

So, when/if recover starts, I’ll check in. I know you guys are all wishing for the best, so no need to tell me. It’s a given. Thank you in advance.

We changed ours last year from State Farm to AAA. Car insurance fell by half! And it decreased again this year. Unfortunately AAA can’t insure our condo, so that remains with State Farm. Weird because they insure other units in our complex, but their policies changed in 2018 as our complex is now considered a fire risk (it backs onto a wetlands, go figure).

Makes you wonder if oil is sturdier than gas, who made the decision to use gas in the first place? Did they even mention the option prior to selecting it for you? Somehow I think $$ had something to do with your health insurance/doctor's decision.

I seriously question the medical/dental field now, as I already had my ""complications"" with my dentist probably needlessly recommending a quick fix crown which spiraled into a later root canal and then another temp crown and then finally a permanent crown #2.

Comps didn't lag the trends in 2004-2007. That was the problem. The appraisers were simply rubber-stamping whatever someone was willing to pay without looking at realistic values. Then, they were slower to come down than the speed at which they went up. I'd say there is more lag on the down side than the upside; simply because, well, human greed.

On one episode TOH was pushing an electric shutoff valve for the hot/cold water hookups for a clothes washer. At the time our new washer/dryer combo blocked the manual shutoff valve so we had the electronic valve installed. In theory it was supposed to sense when the washer powered up and open the water valves. In practice it never worked. Not once. My plumber contacted the company and did his best to troubleshoot it but he had no success. I ended up returning it and we reoriented the washer/dryer to where I could reach the manual valve.
OK, here’s my washing machine shut-off valve story:

As I’ve said before a few times, Mrs. j ALWAYS shuts off the hot and cold water valves and bleeds off the pressure in the hoses after EVERY use of the washing machine and double checks to see that it’s done before going to bed. I’ve told her about what can happen if the hoses rupture so I’ve pretty much put the fear of the water gods in her. She has done this from day one in our first house that we lived in for almost 20 years. So, I’ll take credit for that.

Fast forward to when we bought our second house in January 1989. I saw that the shut-off valves were old and corroded and one valve had a leaking valve stem packing seal so that was the perfect time to replace them and I decided rather than install the multi-turn valve, I was going to install the lever operated 1/4 turn type valves. Got out my torch one night and got it done. Almost perfect timing too because Mrs. j came down to the basement to do a load of clothes since I told her the job should only take about a half hour barring any problems. She looks at the 1/4 turn valves and says, “what are those things”? I said, “those are the new shut-off valves and they’re ready to go”. She fires back, “and you think I’m going to learn how to use those contraptions”.😟 I said, “you’re going to like these and I showed her how to operate them”. She gives me one of those looks and says, “ALL those years you let me turn turn (as she’s goes through the valve turning motion) those valves in the old house when you could have installed those”? 😫😫 I swear, if we would have been upstairs I would have been doing laps around the dining room table.

I’m not sure you can bleed off the hose pressure with the new fangaled electronic machines. Our washer is an ancient Maytag with the mechanical timer so it’s very easy to do on those types of machines. I hope that by talking about the age of this old beast it doesn’t decide to quit. I usually don’t talk about appliances and cars that are old but still work and work well. I damn sure hope this doesn’t jinx it but my excuse, if it’s listening, is that I’m only responding to your post. You better hope I’m right because if something happens, Mrs. will be making a road trip to Nova Scotia since she does not like having to learn how to use new appliances or cars.

FWIW, I know you guys probably howl when you hear what we do about shutting down the washing machine every day but we’re used to doing it and we damn sure don’t forget to shut off the water when we’re going to be away for a few days or more and I bleed off the pressure in the supply lines via the laundry tub valves. Everybody can do that.

Believe it or not, for a few years when we lived in our first house, I even shut off the gas at the meter when we went on vacation which required re-lighting the pilot lights for the water heater and the furnace when we got home. I finally gave up on that because Mrs. j would say when we were driving home from the beach in the Summer (no A/C back then) and got close to home how good it would feel to take a nice hot shower. I had to tell her she’d have to wait for about an hour to do that. Needless to say she didn’t like that. So, I gave up that idea.

The guy doing the work wasn't a plumber but had the crimp tool to install PEX tubing so he did that. He asked me to go down to the basement and turn on the water using the valve next to the water meter. It was the original threaded valve installed in 1955 when the house was built, and very stiff. With some difficulty I did it, then a moment later heard the sound of a ""PFFFFT"" followed by the sound of running water and the guy yelling at me to turn it off. It was so stiff I could barely get it closed. His connection had failed and there was water everywhere in the furnace room. It was probably the first time it was mopped in decades when we cleaned it all up. When he redid the work turning off the main supply line seemed even harder and I decided I would hire someone to replace that valve with a new ball unit. That was not as expensive as I feared but it involved the water utility having to turn off the line coming into the house from out in the street, which fortunately they did at no charge. But having that new valve there has already come in handy a few times since.

dryer worked great up there. Basically where they had it violated fire code so badly I am surprised the house never burned down. way too long a run, with a ton of bends and curves.

If I told my wife how to turn off the valves and bleed the hoses after using the washing machine because of what would happen if the hose ruptures she would tell me to get better hoses for the washing machine.
First off, I wouldn’t let my wife tell me about hose replacement or how to take care of appliances. I’m the house guru on that stuff and she knows it.

Now that I got that out of the way, I did some scouting for the age of our ancient Maytag washing machine that we inherited from my Mother when we moved back from SC in 1997 after she died and my brothers wanted us to stay in her house until we found one. I found the receipt and she bought it on 10-21-89 for $541.66 including tax from a local mom and pop appliance store. Just as an aside this washer HAD to have the suds return feature which probably made it a more top of the line unit. There is a story about this feature but it would be a full size novel so I’m not going there. Mrs. j has never used the suds return feature so the pickup hose just sits on the laundry tub. As best as I know, the supply hoses have never been replaced. I know for sure we never replaced them. They are the old style black hoses not the new fangled braided type. I’m willing to bet they have lasted this long because they have never been been under full pressure all the time. I’m just doing a long term experiment to prove the value of using the water supply shut-off valves and bleeding off the pressure.

I saw where the question was asked about how long washing machine hoses last and their seems to be info that they should be replaced anywhere from 5 to 10 years. To me that is too much of a span to be meaningful. None of us would think very much of a car warranty that states you can expect anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 miles of maintainace free life. However, it is recommended that they be replaced at some point. It’s therefore up to the owner to decide. While the braided hoses last longer they don’t last forever. Guess wrong and you lose. Because there is maintenance involved with them, I don’t like using them for the toilets and sinks. I do those the old fashioned way using the chrome plated soft copper lines. The way I look at it is, why do an installation that you know will require maintenance at some point? I just bite the bullet and do it once. Everyone can start laughing now.

Now that I got that out of the way, I did some scouting for the age of our ancient Maytag washing machine that we inherited from my Mother when we moved back from SC in 1997 after she died and my brothers wanted us to stay in her house until we found one. I found the receipt and she bought it on 10-21-89 for $541.66 including tax from a local mom and pop appliance store. Just as an aside this washer HAD to have the suds return feature which probably made it a more top of the line unit. There is a story about this feature but it would be a full size novel so I’m not going there. Mrs. j has never used the suds return feature so the pickup hose just sits on the laundry tub. As best as I know, the supply hoses have never been replaced. I know for sure we never replaced them. They are the old style black hoses not the new fangled braided type. I’m willing to bet they have lasted this long because they have never been been under full pressure all the time. I’m just doing a long term experiment to prove the value of using the water supply shut-off valves and bleeding off the pressure.

I saw where the question was asked about how long washing machine hoses last and their seems to be info that they should be replaced anywhere from 5 to 10 years. To me that is too much of a span to be meaningful. None of us would think very much of a car warranty that states you can expect anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 miles of maintainace free life. However, it is recommended that they be replaced at some point. It’s therefore up to the owner to decide. While the braided hoses last longer they don’t last forever. Guess wrong and you lose. Because there is maintenance involved with them, I don’t like using them for the toilets and sinks. I do those the old fashioned way using the chrome plated soft copper lines. The way I look at it is, why do an installation that you know will require maintenance at some point? I just bite the bullet and do it once. Everyone can start laughing now.

$541 was a good chunk of change back in 1989. I don’t think washers are much more today. No wonder production was off shored

Well folks, I’m in the market for a natural gas combination (combi) boiler and hot water system to replace my inefficient 20+ year monster cast iron Utica boiler. I’ve called my trusted HVAC guy and he is recommending one of these two systems. The Viessmann Vitodens 100 or a Navien.

Both systems are high efficiency combi boilers rated at 95.0% AFUE but the Viessmann is more expensive, but more reliable according to him. How much more? I don’t know as is he working on a price quote for both. These units look so “small” I wonder if they are capable heating a 2800 sq. ft. home as well as provide on demand hot water for bathing, dishwashing and laundry.

For those who have recently upgraded to a high efficiency boiler, any recommendations? I would appreciate that. Thanks.
Not sure I've posted here before, but:

I bought a (early 1960's era) house in NH in 2015 that has a Vitodens 100 nat. gas boiler installed. I think it's great. 1648 s.f. house. I can't find the receipt from the former owner so I don't know what she paid. I did find the paperwork for removal of the underground oil tank tho: $2550. And I remember seeing the receipt for the removal of the old oil burner also, lotsa bucks IIRC.

Oh, & mine is not a combi unit--just for heating, not hot water. I guess they must make 2 different versions?"

The rubber hoses on our previous washer had a stamp on the sides that said replace after 5 years.

Our washer had gone about 7 and the lower bearing was making noise. IT got replaced. Otherwise I would have bought new hoses.

370,Oct-14,abacomike,"I got a letter today from an insurance agent up near Daytona Beach, about 200 miles north of where I live. The letter stated that Allstate was writing condo policies again in my area and that he could save me quite a bit of money.

Having nothing to lose, I gave him a call. For an exact policy with the same limits, the premium was $769 for a 12 month policy. That’s a savings of over $700 a year compared to my existing policy. But I had to couple my auto policy with the condo policy. A 6 month premium with the same coverages was $95 less than I am currently paying GEICO. So tomorrow I will cancel my policies and start a new auto and condo policy with the Allstate agency up there near Daytona Beach. But I will make sure he sends me binders for both policies before I cancel the other policies.

Was definitely worth taking a few minutes to check out his agency.

Actually, preheating water with solar goes back at least to the 70s. We considered that when we built but like everything else back then the capital costs made it impractical. We just didn’t have any spare money for innovative applications.

420,Oct-13,roadburner,"On one episode TOH was pushing an electric shutoff valve for the hot/cold water hookups for a clothes washer. At the time our new washer/dryer combo blocked the manual shutoff valve so we had the electronic valve installed. In theory it was supposed to sense when the washer powered up and open the water valves. In practice it never worked. Not once. My plumber contacted the company and did his best to troubleshoot it but he had no success. I ended up returning it and we reoriented the washer/dryer to where I could reach the manual valve.

Yikes! What a mess. We've had two trees come down like that. No fun. Good luck with the clean up.
Urban trees are certainly a mixed blessing, not just for property damage but (up here at least and no doubt elsewhere) power outages caused by falling limbs or entire trees. We had one here earlier this week in my area just for that reason.

Back around 2002 one lost a large limb in an ice storm and grazed the '78 Delta 88 I had at the time. City paid for the damage since it was their tree.

Eyeball update (for those who care). Not sure if the surgery went well or not. The Surgeon thinks so. But, when they tested me the day after surgery, the nurse (optometrist?) who tested me before the retinal surgeon came in, said something disconcerting while testing me.

I am not able to see the eye chart the day after the surgery. Now, I’m not sure if I’m supposed to be able to see it or not. But, when I asked her what she thought after the exam, she said she wasn’t optimistic. About what? She deferred to the surgeon, who subsequently came in and said the surgery went well.

Hmmmmm......

Anyway, still not able to see much out of the repaired eye. They put in a gas bubble to hold the retina in place. Those who have had this done know what that means. Head down the majority of the day. Sleep with nose pointing to floor (as if you can sleep that way).

I’m pretty cranky because I haven’t slept in two days.

The positive side, I have good vision in my “good eye”. Jury is still out on my other eye.

So, total number of surgeries on the “bad eye” is up to 5. Surgeon said he wouldn’t attempt another one if this one fails.

Maybe start practicing on becoming a pirate!

Sorry to hear that there might be problems. I’m impressed by how you’re taking this. If someone botched my eye surgery I’d be throwing furniture and tearing the sheets. Hope that things improve.

Looks like a cool place. I love breweries. This whole pandemic really put a damper on the only fun thing we usually did on weekends (visiting various microbreweries).
Most of the ones in our area have big, socially distanced patios. If they don't, we don't go.

But, the weather will kill that pretty soon...

One that comes to mind is Tieton Cider Works, possibly found more in eastern WA, but I think I have seen it on the west side too. When I was a kid, my aunt and uncle lived in Tieton and at one time had an orchard, so it catches my eye.

A little trivia here, most pirates wore an eye patch to block light from reaching the eye. This would prepare the eye for low light vision. When they would go below deck where light was very limited they would take off the eye patch and be able to see very well in low light conditions. This proved valuable for raids and battles.
Pilots of nuclear bombers employed the same trick except they kept one eye covered in case the flash of an exploding nuke would blind them, they had a spare eye to fly the plane.

Another thing that I wonder about is all the extra conversations that are going on about all kinds of things, while a guys abdomen is open on the table and doctors and nurses are running around trying to keep the guy alive.

During my last colonoscopy I woke up a bit early. It started with 2 docs in the room, when I woke up but acted like I was still under I could hear about 5 people laughing and joking and talking about what they were planning on doing for the weekend...while my butt was the centerpiece of the whole party.

@graphicguy, the gas bubble placed in the eyeball stabilizes the “globe” until you make more vitreous fluid and it replaces the bubble. I assume you had a vitrectomy (removal of vitreous) along with reattachment of the retinal tear/detachment. The bubble is the cause of the “blacked out” vision in that eye. Once the bubble is absorbed, vision is restored. It takes weeks, or more (in my case), for that to happen. When I went through that I felt like I was looking through a dense aquarium, and the water was being drained slowly, as the bubble was being resolved, until I could see more and more from the eye. In general, I found it unpleasant to try and read or watch tv. I subscribed to AUDIBLE and had books read to me. I got claustrophobic and felt better sitting outside in the shade, just relaxing, listening to music, and chatting with visitors. I know the feelings at times can be quite disconcerting, but rest-assured it too will pass. Most likely, you will get most, if not not your total vision back - I did. Best to you for a fast and complete recovery.

Oh, and doctors cannot give guarantees but from experience, they can give appropriate prognoses. Not all, but most are forthcoming with their surgical results.

Thanks so much. The first time I had this surgery (in the same eye), the surgeon put in an oil fluid, which provided vision within 48 hours. But, the oil had to be removed via another surgery weeks later. That’s my reference.

Given the amount of surgeries on my eyes, I’m a bit nervous about the outcome. My surgeon also cautioned that because of all the surgical events on my eyes, there was a significant risk regarding my visual acuity moving forward. He was pleased with initial post surgery observations. But, anything can happen.

Your experience sounds close to what I’m experiencing. The other issue relates to all the gyrations I have to go through to assure the retina healing correctly (face down, sleeping nose perpendicular to the floor, aching neck and shoulders as a result of those gyrations, etc).

I feel better hearing amount similar experiences and their outcomes.

Again, thanks for listening to me whine!

Navien - 100%. It has to be installed, piped, and vented perfectly, otherwise you’ll have issues with it. This is for your MA home I presume? These tankless combi boilers work much better if the ground water coming into the unit is warm. My Dad (we own a plumbing supply business) has a traditional Natural Gas water heater that is set to heat the water to 100 degrees, then the Navien pulls water from that.

Thanks @nyccarguy and yes the unit is for my MA home. I will use that info to negotiate a price break with HVAC guy. And thanks for the tip on the warm water angle. I'm not quite sure if this is possible since ground water is relatively cold.

Ain’t that the truth. The squirrels here chew the last 9 inches of the branches off my oaks so they can gather the nuts off the ground. Makes quite the clatter when you try to mow over all the brush they leave. No nuts though.

The only issue I have with Goose Island is that back in the 90s they bought out a brewery in Elmhurst, IL called Baderbraugh which was considered one of the best beers in the world and they closed it down.

Another real good brewery here is called Two Brothers. They have some real good beers, maybe it's because its next to a particle accelerator, I dont know.

A little trivia here, most pirates wore an eye patch to block light from reaching the eye. This would prepare the eye for low light vision. When they would go below deck where light was very limited they would take off the eye patch and be able to see very well in low light conditions. This proved valuable for raids and battles.

Glad you're back and posting again! Good to hear that your surgeon is optimistic and hope your recovery goes well. Lack of sleep is a problem but like you say, who can sleep in that position? When you say that you're not yet seeing much out of the affected eye, is it because everything looks so blurry right now? With many weeks of recovery to go we'll hope and pray for the best outcome.

Five surgeries on the affected eye is brutal. My older brother has had two. But your description of ""pretty cranky"" seems much more restrained than when I get like that! Good job man.

Mike...no disagreement. The more I think about it, the less stock I put in her advice (optometrist/nurse). Still, unnerved me a bit.

The gas bubble that's in my eye to stabilize the retina is what's causing the lack of vision (according to the convo I had with the surgeon yesterday).

@graphicguy, the gas bubble placed in the eyeball stabilizes the “globe” until you make more vitreous fluid and it replaces the bubble. I assume you had a vitrectomy (removal of vitreous) along with reattachment of the retinal tear/detachment. The bubble is the cause of the “blacked out” vision in that eye. Once the bubble is absorbed, vision is restored. It takes weeks, or more (in my case), for that to happen. When I went through that I felt like I was looking through a dense aquarium, and the water was being drained slowly, as the bubble was being resolved, until I could see more and more from the eye. In general, I found it unpleasant to try and read or watch tv. I subscribed to AUDIBLE and had books read to me. I got claustrophobic and felt better sitting outside in the shade, just relaxing, listening to music, and chatting with visitors. I know the feelings at times can be quite disconcerting, but rest-assured it too will pass. Most likely, you will get most, if not not your total vision back - I did. Best to you for a fast and complete recovery.

@driver100, are the bifocal glasses you’re talking about the old-school ones with the visible double lens appearance or the progressive lens bifocals with no visible separation of the lenses. With the progressives, I’ve never noticed a tennis ball going from one sight line to another.
Carnaught, The latest one I witnessed at tennis had progressive actual glasses. He just got them so he may not have got used to them, but he said he was missing more than usual because of the difference in line of vision. I thought progressive lenses don't have an actual line where the lens changes, but at some point the lens transitions from long views on top to close up views in the bottom half. Wouldn't there have to be a transition point?

529,Oct-06,ab348,"When I first got progressives I was still playing golf and I did have a hard time when on the tee because I had to drop my chin to see the ball clearly without blurriness from the reading portion of the lens. Over time I seemed to adapt though. I remember the optician telling me that he sold some golfers single-vision lenses and frames that they used when playing golf for that very reason, but that then they couldn't read or write on their scorecards.

What ab said about golf is a good example of what I was concerned about....BUT, if it was a problem for golfing where the ball is stationary, it could be a bigger problem for tennis where the ball is moving and you have to watch the ball. I think single vision for tennis may be the answer........this info is a good start.
Great analogy stick, and you even used a car analogy - extra points! Not sure which is better, a 2 speed power glide or a CVT.

That was my problem with progressives they tend to have an hourglass shape to their viewing area, looking through the middle they give no peripheral vision and are only good for direct vision. The left and right extremes of the lens are not as strongly “progressive” as the central, vertical corridor, giving blurry vison to the sides. That's why I use non progressive bifocals.

I agree, Michaell. I've worn progressives for years - first for nearsightedness and now for farsightedness.

I use a pair of reading glasses when using the computer, which is a rarity for me. I use my iPhone for almost everything except for printing and word-processing.

My reading glasses are 2.5's but when the optometrist prescribed my progressives, the reading portion of my glasses are 3.0's.

I agree. I’ve always said don’t knock it until you get there. I guess when you get to my (our) age you have lots of stories. Surprise, I have a story about getting old too:

As I’ve said before several times, I was asked by my employer to come back as a consultant because of the experience you have when you’re older. Not too long before I really retired, I was at a meeting with a lot of people I knew for a lot of years but there were a few I didn’t know. After the meeting one of the guys I didn’t know (seemed to be a pretty good guy in his 40’s) came over to me and extended his hand and said, “I’m glad I finally got to meet you, I’ve heard a lot about you”. I said, “all good, I’m sure”. He then said with a smile, “we’ll, to be honest, no”. I told him I liked honesty. He said he’s always been honest and says “there’s nothing wrong with being honest. From what I’ve heard about you, that seems to be your trademark”. He then blurts out, “just how old are you”? After I told him he said, “man, how’d you ever get to be that old especially in this place”. I said, “by not asking dumb questions like that”. Several of the guys I knew were hanging around and one said, “I think we should leave now before we see something we shouldn’t see”. I wasn’t going to hurt that kid, honest.

We had our roof replaced in the middle of June 2018. It was rediculously humid that day and they started at about 7:30 AM. The weather was perfect up until that day. We have a typical two story colonial with a low side family room on one side. Since it was so humid the crew of 5 stopped on the first day at about 3 PM, otherwise they said they could have finished in one day so they came back for a couple hours the next day to finish up.

I felt bad for them having to be out in the heat that first day and insisted that they took a couple breaks to get into the cool garage and have some water. I had beer in the fridge too but I wasn’t offering that until they finished on the first day. When they finished on the first day I ask them if the wanted a beer. Only one guy took me up on my offer the others just wanted more water. After a couple swigs of beer the guy said, “any beer would be good right now but this Yuengling beer is REALLY GOOD right now”. That made one of the other guys ask for one too. If there was ever a day made for beer drinking after a roofing job that was the day. I decided to have one too and I only watched for a little while. 😁

I agree that Yuengling Beer is one of the best lager beers made in the USA. There is a brewery in Tampa and of course in PA.

Every so often my friends and I have lunch at an authentic German restaurant. We always order one of dark beers they have on tap. To me, KOSTRITZER DARK LAGER and FRANZISKANER DARK are their best. Once you taste beer like those mentioned above, every other beer is just OK. These are terrific and delicious.

I also was surprised to hear @Michaell say he had Rolling Rock in his fridge. Yep, for the longest time it was brewed only in Latrobe Pa (Arnie Palmer’s birthplace). I live and worked in a town about 40 miles from Latrobe and worked with a guy (just retired 2 years ago) who lives to this day in Latrobe. I used to hear him complain all the time about his commute. A long time ago I told him to move to where I live (my commute was less than 2 miles), or get a job closer to home. His response was, “how many EE’s do you think Rolling Rock needs”.

Had to wear glasses to drive and hated it. Surgery went well but needed reading glasses afterwards. Not happy about that. They had to tweak it again about 4 years ago. Then I had a floater in that left eye. Saw the retina guy and luckily, no surgery needed but we're keeping a close eye on it.
Still hate wearing the readers but, if that's the worst of it, so be it! I know G-d will watch over you and things will turn out great!!

If you don't ""seize"" the opportunity now to become a snowbird, you'll end up having ""seizures"" from the cold winters and snow in Pittsburgh! Make ""hay when the Florida sun shines"" jmonroe! 🤓😜🤪
No one has a worse excuse than me for not being a snowbird. My Delray Beach SIL is tired of asking us to come down for the Winter and stay with her. She has a pretty big house so that really wouldn’t be too much of an imposition. We even had a standing offer before my middle brother died in January of 2013. I keep telling Mrs. j that we should do it for at least a month just to be nice but she says if we ever do it we have to get an apartment like real snowbirds do it. Every time I decide to look into that, something comes up and then I forget and then it’s too late. When Mrs. j complains about that to my SIL my SIL says, “my offer still stands” and then we’re back to square one again.

The company doesn’t always buy bottom line trim but this one certainly was. I should have looked for a trim badge. It did perform well. In sport mode it moved out well. If that picture is the GT trim it hasn’t even come out yet has it?

Looking up specs, the car I drove must have had the turbo 1.6 with 180hp. That’s detuned from the same engine in the Soul that gave you 201hp.

I went to drive the cargo van which has been sitting awhile and it almost didn’t start because of a weak battery. No idea how old it is but it came with the van in 2016.

The only time our 2011 Pilot ever died was in our driveway. At 101K miles, the alternator gave up the ghost. We had it towed to a local place to have it replaced. I got a 2 for 1 from AAA that day. The tow truck driver said I had to follow him to drop the Pilot off. I hopped in my Prelude and that was dead too. It needed a jump.

GG - so sorry to hear that you again have to deal with a detached retina. I will be praying for you and for a speedy, positive recovery. Just know we are all here pulling for you.

One thing I have learned after going through two cataract surgeries in the past 8 months - being able to see well, especially at my age, is a true gift. My Dad had macular degeneration in both his eyes and was almost totally blind at the end of his life. I took him for those injections into his eye to clear up the macular, but it didn't work out for him. I pray my eyes are in great shape until the day I die. Sight, hearing, and the senses of smell and taste are essential.

Good luck, GG!

I recall the 500 came out around the same time as the Chrysler 300. And was much roomier with nice big windows, great visibility, etc. But the 300 had ""gangster"" style. So I assume Ford decided they had to compete with that so windows became gunslits, roof was squashed, etc. Basically trying to mimic the style at the expense of practicality.

626,Oct-04,graphicguy,"Got a call at 7:45 a.m. from my friendly Acura sales person yesterday. He wanted to know if I could to a 2021 TLX transfer with their Dayton store. Sure thing. Be there in 15 minutes. He was there early, at least for a Saturday. He said he had a GREAT week.

Transported a Tech Package up, and an Advance Package back. He asked what I thought. I was polite and said it was a great car.

Sitting in my Stinger I was taken by how much I still preferred it to the new TLX. And, mine is “only” in the 2nd model year. I like the Stinger’s tech better because of the better way it functions and was integrated. Tech was the same, just done much better in my Stinger.

This new TLX is SLOWER than the one I had....at least by my buttometer. Yes, it had more low end torque, but once my V6 TLX got on the boil, it was a rocket. Mine made better sounds, too.

The new TLX does handle better. It’s clear they tweaked the SH AWD. The interior was very nice. Hard to believe they improved the already great stereo, but they did.

When he came back he said, “we can’t find your keys right now so let’s talk about the car you want some more” as he turns over his work sheet and starts writing down some numbers. I said, “I’m not going to play that game so just give me my damn keys”. He ignored me and continues to write down more numbers. I jumped out of my chair so fast the back of my knees pushed the chair at least 10 feet behind me across the tile floor and falls over making some noise. I’m grabbing the edge of the desk and pulling myself to get around the desk to get at him. He now starts screaming, “OK, Ok, I found them”. I’m now on his side of the desk and he shoves out his left hand and says, “here they are, here they are”. I grab them and put them in my pocket and I said to my relatively new bride, “let’s get the hell out of here”. She is bewildered and said, “what happened” ? I said, “that salesman almost got his lights turned out, let’s go”.

I had my shot August 31. I had a stronger reaction to this one this year. Kroger pharmacist gave it: free

I had a flu shot on Thurs., Oct 1. I had a slight reaction too. I usually have no reaction or maybe slight pain at the injection site for a day.

Who the hell knows? I think it was from a botched LASIK surgery I had years ago. I was NEVER able to become totally ocular healthy since I had the LASIK done. Of course, trying to get anyone to admit that is another story.

My eye problems started right after my LASIK surgery. I think they blow through so many of them at those LASIK places, and they have some much faith in the machines that do them (very little physician interaction) that they feel they’re no vulnerable to mistakes. Same with follow up.....get’ em in-get’em out, as quickly as possible.

This will be my 2nd detached retina surgery. So, I sort of know what to expect.

Retinal detachment has been reported after LASIK although it is hard to say if it was due to the extreme nearsightedness because it is more common in people with severe nearsightedness. Also more common in age >50, family or personal history of retinal detachment, previous eye injury or previous eye surgery (usually cataract extraction)

Good luck with the procedure.

Best wishes on the surgery and recovery.

I knew I'd read that detached retina occurred after cataract lens replacement. So I found a source
that nearsighted folks have a higher incidence. But this is a long time after the Lasik? I think you
talked about your detachment years ago...

Got a call at 7:45 a.m. from my friendly Acura sales person yesterday. He wanted to know if I could to a 2021 TLX transfer with their Dayton store. Sure thing. Be there in 15 minutes. He was there early, at least for a Saturday. He said he had a GREAT week.

Transported a Tech Package up, and an Advance Package back. He asked what I thought. I was polite and said it was a great car.

Sitting in my Stinger I was taken by how much I still preferred it to the new TLX. And, mine is “only” in the 2nd model year. I like the Stinger’s tech better because of the better way it functions and was integrated. Tech was the same, just done much better in my Stinger.

This new TLX is SLOWER than the one I had....at least by my buttometer. Yes, it had more low end torque, but once my V6 TLX got on the boil, it was a rocket. Mine made better sounds, too.

The new TLX does handle better. It’s clear they tweaked the SH AWD. The interior was very nice. Hard to believe they improved the already great stereo, but they did.

Styling is a continuation of what they started in the last generation. Does it look better? It looks good. Not sure I’d say it looks better. Something about the rear of the car looks chopped off.

As was said, nearsightedness and age are risk factors, plus glaucoma, trauma and idiopathic. All the best with your upcoming surgery. Bottom line is if you notice a continued loss in your visual field (or larger ""shower curtain"" in your vision) in the meantime, you may have to move up your date of surgery, so do not hesitate to bring that to the surgeon's attention. As one who went through it myself I know that quick action had much to do with my getting my vision restored. We're all pulling and praying for you and an excellent result!"

As a result I started late in my field when I did get my degree but eventually became the manager of a well respected engineering group. Retired, then went back to work as a consultant for my old company and worked until I was over 70. I was happy for all those opportunities but happiest that I was lucky.

one plausible answer is slopping pouring into the filler neck. Maybe some got splashed into a spot where there was a hollow, and they did not bother to mop it up, and it was splashing out onto the manifold. Eventually you will run out.

Man, does that bring back memories. Sometimes they can find your keys quickly when they want to. Here’s my key story:

During Pontiac introduction week of their 1968’s in late October or early November of 1967, I was going to trade in my ‘66 Bonneville for a new ‘68. There was no good reason for doing this but I made up my mind to buy a new car. I was only married a few months so that made it even more of a stupid decision but like I said I made up my mind. I went to the dealer I bought my ‘66 from but couldn’t come to terms so I went to what used to be another pretty respectable Pontiac dealer. But they changed. When I couldn’t come to terms with that dealer and asked for my keys the salesman goes off to get them. When he came back he said, “we can’t find your keys right now so let’s talk about the car you want some more” as he turns over his work sheet and starts writing down some numbers. I said, “I’m not going to play that game so just give me my damn keys”. He ignored me and continues to write down more numbers. I jumped out of my chair so fast the back of my knees pushed the chair at least 10 feet behind me across the tile floor and falls over making some noise. I’m grabbing the edge of the desk and pulling myself to get around the desk to get at him. He now starts screaming, “OK, Ok, I found them”. I’m now on his side of the desk and he shoves out his left hand and says, “here they are, here they are”. I grab them and put them in my pocket and I said to my relatively new bride, “let’s get the hell out of here”. She is bewildered and said, “what happened” ? I said, “that salesman almost got his lights turned out, let’s go”.

When we got to the car I explained to her what happened. She was shocked that they would do something like that. The more I thought about how quickly the salesman “found my keys” the more I’m convinced he had to have my keys in his left hand all the time because there was no way in hell he could open the desk drawer and get them and close the drawer by the time I got around to his side of the desk. So, when you’re 25 years old you can convince a 40 something year old you’re not going to play that game.

Yes, but with one correction: it is NOT your property, you are just responsible for it. I find the whole concept absurd. I have a runoff basin within my property boundaries. It is I'd say 1/3 of my 4.5 acres. It burns me up that I have to mow the damned thing, BUT I'm grateful it gives me so much buffer from anyone/anything else.
I agree it is absurd. Is what it is I guess.

The new house has two small trees planted on the grass strip between the street and sidewalk. I’m pulling them right the heck out so that in ten years I’m not replacing that sidewalk. The roots will certainly lift it.

I suppose I’ll need HOA approval for that but knowing me I’ll do it and ask for forgiveness later.

As to your comment about this being the first Honda Civic ""punch"" here, there is a reason for that - which one of us being of sound mind and in love with our God-given precious bodies would buy or lease a Civic Coupe (one of us guys who live and breathe cars as a hobby) for themselves as a daily driver? I have driven in this one where my knees were almost touching my lips while sitting in the front passenger seat! That poor salesman had to sit in the rear seat! But for a 50 year old woman/daughter who is fairly slim and stands 5'5"" tall in her sneakers - it was perfect.🤓😜🤪
There are quite a few women in this area driving Civics, younger and older.

Among older ladies, the Accord gets a few and Camry gets several. Add in some Cadillac sedans and suvs, but the rest are Hyundai/Kia models. Right after Buick discontinued the leSabre and Park Avenue, many purchasers went to toyota models. But that has changed. Buick Encores are still popular along with Chevy Traxx.

I had a doctors appt. at 11 am. I made an appointment to get Mrs. Ventures Ascent inspected at 2 pm. (I pay for her car. I pay for her insurance. I pay for her registration. I pay for the maintenance. All I ask is for her to let me know when It needs inspected. It expired yesterday. ) So far so good.

Last evening when I got home the garage door would only open about 2 inches. One of the torsion springs had broken.

I stopped at the garage door place this morning and they said they could stop sometime today and replace the springs. They were really busy so they would call before showing up. I would be at work, but that’s only 5 minutes from my house. I mentioned I had to take the Ascent to the dealer at 2 pm. As I was on my way to the dealer, the garage door place called and said they were at my house and couldn’t get in.

When I got to the dealer they asked if I wanted it washed. I said I did not want them to wash it. They use one of those machines with the brushes on it. After I paid for the inspection and oil change, I went to the car and they washed it.

It does not have to result in buying a new car. We looked at several low-mileage pre-owned vehicles and for $6,000 more, she has a brand new car, a 6 year/100,000 mile warranty, and a car that ""she"" picked out. Her payment is for $329 a month for 75 months. Her credit scores were not good - we were lucky she was able to finance at all. 6.1% is not bad considering her existing debt and scores.

I had thought about paying the whole thing, but that gives her no responsibility for her car and I really can't afford to deplete my capital that much. $8000.00 is enough to help her get to a payment that she can barely manage on her two or three jobs (5-day job during the week and 2-part time jobs over the weekends). I did not want to get the warranty, but since she keeps her cars until they just ""die"", the extended warranty will provide her with a cushion should anything happen to the car after the Honda warranty is over. The warranty she purchased ($1600) also covers items such as hoses, belts, wipers, etc., above and beyond what Honda warrants. She was the one who wanted the extended warranty, not me.

Bottom line, cdnpinhead, she's my daughter, I love her, and I want her to be as happy as possible!
All very valid reasons but the last one is the only one that matters. Funny, $8,000 is just about what I paid for my son’s car.

Bad decision all the way. Might be a good car to teach her manual shifting but giving her a sports car as her first one can only cause problems. Get her a 15 year old Buick and tell her to save her pennies for something better.

our neighborhood is now going on 30 YO. and when it was built, they planted trees close to the curb (where there was no sidewalk) and in that strip between the curb and sidewalk on that side. Well, of course, they got big and now the HOA is spending money cutting down dead ones, and there are heaved sidewalks and roots running along the surface of the grass. Trees don't have good roots so don't survive and look like crap. I knew when we moved in near the beginning it was going to be a disaster. Thankfully, original owner of our house had them leave the tree out so not an issue for us.

I agree that you can just go dig them out (heck, relocate elsewhere on the property) and if anyone comes after you, just act dumb. do it really early on a Sunday morning so nobody sees you.

So needed the car up in the air high enough to at least get a creeper under there to get them off (so it could then fall on you). Then the oil filter was in an awkward location. So just getting the underside part done was a messy job, and difficult to do without getting the car decently far off the ground.

At 8:00 AM this morning, I received a call from my daughter, crying her heart out - literally - because as she approached her office, her 2010 Honda Accord EX Coupe had just came to a crunching halt. She had to get help from her staff to push the car into the recreation center where she works. I could feel her tears as she went on and on over the fact that she is in trouble and looking for help from dear old Dad.

She told me she was having her car towed to her mechanic's garage to see what could be done. I suggested that she have the car towed to her local Honda Dealership since, as she described what happened to me over the phone, it sounded like either her engine gave out or that something was wrong with the transaxle. She followed my advice and had the car towed to the Honda dealer. I told her I would help her and, after showering and shaving, I drove up to her work and picked her up.

I drove her to her apartment so she could pick up the title to the Honda Accord EX Coupe, her checkbook (which had enough in the account to pay for a nice dinner at Morton's Steakhouse, but not a penny more, and her insurance paper work. I then drove her to the Honda Dealer. She tried out several models and finally landed on a Honda Civic EX Coupe in white with black cloth interior. MSRP was about $24,455 which included shipping. Edmund's stated that the average purchase price was $22,908. Then they added dealers fee of $999, tinting, pinstriping, and a bunch of other BS add-ons for $1800, 7% sales tax (6% + $50.00), DMV stuff, etc., and came up with a price out the door of $27,990. I told them I would give them one price - if they met that price we would buy the car - if not, we walk. My offer was $26,000 out the door. They argued that I was not paying for the dealer fee or the add-ons and wanted the car for dead invoice. I responded ""YES""! After about 20 minutes, he came back and said they couldn't meet my price. Their counter offer was for $26,001.00. They were being cute.

Now that we had arrived at a sales price, we needed to find out if she could finance the car. Her credit history is a bit tarnished - I'm being positive here and that was the best way I could describe her FICO score - so they came up with a 6.1% 75 month loan with Wells Fargo, the only bank willing to finance her purchase. Since she keeps a car for many, many years, she also wanted an extended warranty - so through Berkshire-Hathaway, we added a 6 year 100,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty (3 additional years over and above what Honda Warrants) with no deductibles and no exclusions. Honda dealership accepts that insurance up to $5,000 on a consignment basis. Honda didn't offer an extended warranty on this car. So, we added $1700 for the warranty and she ended up with a payment of $329 a month.

Needless to say, I am exhausted from all the rushing around. I really hated the fact that that dealership had leg up on getting a deal done because the broken axled Accord was in their service department and if we didn't buy a new car there, we would have to pay to have it towed somewhere else.

All in all, it was an experience I never, ever want to go through again for the rest of my life. Besides, It cost me $8000 which is $8000 less I have in reserve and $8000 less the kids will inherit.

Speaking of broken cars the Sebring might be ready to give up the ghost. I went out to pick up lunch today as I pulled into my driveway I started to smell a particular smell and noticed a thick white smoke coming up from under the hood. By the time I turned the car off, got out and got the hood open the smoke had stopped. I really couldn't find the source but there was a oil leak under the car. We recently had the oil changed, maybe less than a 100 miles ago, so the wife said she will take it back there tomorrow to have them check their work.

What kind of smell, coolant or oil? Coolant could be a blown head gasket but that shouldn’t result in smoke under the hood. Might just be an old hose going bad. Oil smoke and smell after a change could be a loose plug or a double gasket oil filter. I’ve done the latter myself after changing oil in the dark.

It’s ridiculous and I’m not going to allow them to bully me. Our sidewalk is very old and was poorly patched. We anticipated that, and budgeted for it.

The apron and private walkway to the front door is not bad at all with some minor edge cracking that is flat and zero trip hazard. Same scenario with the driveway apron.

Yet my neighbor has sidewalks that are 6”+ tripping hazards from a tree.

I told my wife I’ll go to the top of this little s*^+ town if I have to. They did nothing but break my you know what since the day I moved in with the electrical service, the addition permits took forever to get and now this.

Funny story about this town. We have a small family owned car dealer here (you know the one). They practically gave the code enforcer a car as a sign of good faith to the town. As a return for the favor in the same week he gave them a stack of violations.

It's an oil smell, I had the oil changed about 3 or 4 weeks ago, but due to working from home and having two three alternate forms of transportation it doesn't get much use at the moment so I likely only have 100 miles on it at most since the last oil change. It does have some small fluid leaks which I decided to live with since repairing them would cost more than the car is worth (Chrysler dealers service advisor advised against it due to the age of the car made it not worth the expense). So it could just be a loose plug from the oil change or one of those leaks getting worse.

Nope, the Sonata and the BMW are with a separate company and the motorcycle is on a third. We used to have all the cars with the same company that the house is on. When we bought the BMW we took it as an opportunity to shop rates. The company that the other two cars are much less expensive than the company we were with however their homeowners insurance, even with a bundling discount, was more expensive. So we didn't move our homeowners insurance and kept the least expensive car to insure there. It basically makes our overall insurance rates as low as we can make them. I estimate that if we drop the Sebring our insurance costs will increase by around $200 a year.

It would actually be the least costly to keep the Sebring on the policy when we get rid of it than to drop it and move one of the other cars over. Not that I would do that.

It does not have to result in buying a new car. We looked at several low-mileage pre-owned vehicles and for $6,000 more, she has a brand new car, a 6 year/100,000 mile warranty, and a car that ""she"" picked out. Her payment is for $329 a month for 75 months. Her credit scores were not good - we were lucky she was able to finance at all. 6.1% is not bad considering her existing debt and scores.

I had thought about paying the whole thing, but that gives her no responsibility for her car and I really can't afford to deplete my capital that much. $8000.00 is enough to help her get to a payment that she can barely manage on her two or three jobs (5-day job during the week and 2-part time jobs over the weekends). I did not want to get the warranty, but since she keeps her cars until they just ""die"", the extended warranty will provide her with a cushion should anything happen to the car after the Honda warranty is over. The warranty she purchased ($1600) also covers items such as hoses, belts, wipers, etc., above and beyond what Honda warrants. She was the one who wanted the extended warranty, not me.

Bottom line, cdnpinhead, she's my daughter, I love her, and I want her to be as happy as possible!

Leaking oil doesn’t smell unless the leak falls on something hot enough to burn it so I’d look for something else. I doubt the drain plug is lose otherwise you’d have oil under the car and probably substantial oil loss. Double gasketing the oil filter causes leaks not burning. Let us know what you find.

the city has a contractor chosen and paid by the city do the repair and then bills the homeowner. That is usually cheaper than having another contractor do it. The city does the summer maintenance in 5 zones, so every 5 years our stuff is inspected and brought up to snuff. Good. That contractor spends the whole spring, summer, and fall doing driveway aprons, sidewalk strips, and curbs in that zone.

The City a couple decades ago had someone go around with a shovel to level the expansion joint material that stuck up between lengths of sidewalk. A lady tripped on one sticking up and sued the city (and a neighbor). Money grubber actually.

The City also tested concrete leveling by having a company inject cement under sidewalk strips that had sunk. Paid by city rather than homeowner to repair drooping sidewalks. (Didn't work very well, except ours is still great after being lifted.)

Well As I stated in my original post there was a bit of smoke coming up from under the hood. So whatever was leaking was hitting something hot. And what I saw under the car looked like oil and had the consistency of oil so maybe it wasn't oil. Damn it Jim, I'm an accountant not a mechanic.

2015 Subaru Outback 3.6R / 2014 MINI Countryman S ALL4"
815,Oct-01,ab348,"Interesting goings-on over at the Glass House in Dearborn today, as new Ford CEO Jim Farley replaced the CFO on his first day on the job:

https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2020/10/01/ford-ceo-jim-farley-replaces-cfo-tim-stone-john-lawler-shakeup/5877284002/
First of all, Farley replaced the relatively new Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone with Ford veteran John Lawler, 54, effective immediately. Lawler will oversee the finance and Ford Motor Credit operations. Stone accepted a job at ASAPPInc., an artificial intelligence software company.

Former CEO Jim Hackett announced the hiring of Stone, 53, who had no automotive experience, in March 2019, despite Stone's controversial departure from his previous employer where he reportedly went around the CEO to seek a pay raise that was denied.

Ford retained former CFO Bob Shanks, who officially retired, on the payroll while also paying Stone. Ford explained at the time that it was to assist with transition; Stone was hired in April 2019 and assumed the job two months later.The company ended up paying the CFO and former CFO more than $8 million each that year, according to its regulatory filings. The company confirmed Thursday that the ""employee advisor"" role ended for Shanks at the end of 2019.

On Feb. 4, when reporting that annual profits plunged from $3.7 billion one year earlier, Tim Stone characterized the company's financial performance as ""not OK.""

In 2019, the cumulative compensation for the six top executives at Ford Motor Co. — $70 million — exceeded the automaker's annual net income of $47 million, a year that included pension payments, global restructuring costs, a botched Ford Explorer launch and billions in warranty costs.

A harsh assessment of outgoing CEO Jim Hackett, the ex-Steelcase furniture exec:
Change brings relief to those who want to see Ford succeed, McElroy said. ""Jim Farley is putting his stamp down and saying, 'I'm running the show.' This fits with everything everyone has been saying about Jim Hackett for the last three years. The guy was not a leader. He never really marshaled the troops to follow behind him. He communicated in very ambiguous and gauzy ways that left people wondering where the company was really headed.""
...

""Other than that, he has been a disaster,"" McElroy said. ""From 2014 to 2019, the U.S. auto industry enjoyed the golden age. We have never seen so many years of back-to-back rising sales and unbelievable profits and Ford turned in an absolutely mediocre performance. Jim Hackett never got control of the company because he never understood what was going on there.""

She originally did not even want to drive a civic coupe - she wanted something more equivalent to the old Honda Accord Coupe which she was used to. After driving an Accord Sedan and a CR-V along with a few pre-owned vehicles. which she said were were way too big for her, she decided to try out the Civic Coupe anyway. Once she started driving it, she said it was almost as big as her old Accord Coupe - Honda has increased the size of the Civic since she last drove one 10 years ago.

This ""selection"" of a vehicle took a lot of strength from this aging body (3 hours) and we hadn't even begun the pricing, let alone the Finance process, which took whatever was left of my strength and patience.

As to your comment about this being the first Honda Civic ""punch"" here, there is a reason for that - which one of us being of sound mind and in love with our God-given precious bodies would buy or lease a Civic Coupe (one of us guys who live and breathe cars as a hobby) for themselves as a daily driver?

Well, if my TSX were totalled tomorrow (assuming I wasn't), a Civic of some sort would certainly be on my short list as a replacement. I can still get a manual transmission, and it has enough gee-gaws to meet my modest needs. Probably Mazda would be in there too, but there's not much else.

I'm more offended and highly biased by people driving hulking heavy giant SUV's while clearly looking down at a cell phone.

I'm also offended when they go 0 to 60 in 2 minutes while merging onto the freeway.

my TL (a 2000) had Xenons. Toward the end, one of them occasionally would go out, but it was intermittent. I knew it was going to be expensive, so as long as it usually was on, I did not bother with it (car did have 175,000 miles on it!) Just so much easier and cheaper to replace a normal bulb.

My Cutlass had the old incandescent sealed beams when got it and the lights were almost theoretical at night. I put in halogen sealed beams and that improved it a lot, damn the originality.

I remember when Dad bought his '73 Volvo new, it was the first car we had with halogen sealed beams. At the time he still had his '68 Volvo as well, which had regular headlights. The difference driving the '73 the first time was remarkable. Not a weak yellowish light but a much stronger beam with almost a blue tinge to it by comparison.

I had the headlight on the bike go out just the other day. It's an easy fix but a very tight working area. I checked replacement bulbs and they were $55 at the low end. Since I was going to the dealership for the oil change and some adjustments in a few days I held off on getting it to see what they would charge. It was $40 for the part and zero for labor.

I feel your pain on that one.

I found that the 15 Cruze needs to have the bumper removed per the book method. One of the headlamp units had the amber plastic internal shield over the amber running light bump break loose. Didn't replace.

My 08 Cobalt just the headlight units pop out and you can replace the bulbs. I just replaced the whole wiring harness (about 12 inches long) for the 3 bulbs on one because the contact for the headlight had corrosion and heated and weakened, reducing voltage due to poor contact. These were replacement headlight units because the originals had fogged a little.

But what I learned long ago, is there is often a different method that can be used without doing the bumper removals to get at the headlight units.

$200 per hour is the rate you paid per their using the book time. That's the incentive the techs have for finding the alternate shortcuts--they get paid book time (and the store does too) and they spend less than book time.

14 Malibu looks like both bulbs, projector and high beam halogen, can be removed by loosening some things behind or just forcing to get a little room.

hint of clouding on the headlights. I recently bought the top rated Sylvania headlamp restoration kit and plan to try it out in a few days. And yes, I realize that it’s a hazardous DIY procedure; I’ll have a fire extinguisher close at hand in case anything bursts into flame.

The only other car I ever changed the fancy new bulbs on was my old Lincoln. It was tricky from a getting my hands in there standpoint but fairly straight forward. The trouble was that the headlight design was poor and the problem wasn’t the bulb it was that the heat from the bulb burned up the reflective material inside the housing.

I searched online and on ebay for a while, reading the reviews of headlight units for the Cobalt. I found one that seemed to have a good reputation and ordered both L and R. Good quality units, and having the plastic housing CLEAR again made a definite difference in the light at night.

I did not want to put in the extra bright bulbs to compensate like the Sylvania bulbs that just blast light everywhere. Those make more heat, pull a little more current, and failed more often.

Possibly, maybe, it was when I wound up with the $1,000 300z, but I think that came much later.

869,Sep-30,abacomike,"At 8:00 AM this morning, I received a call from my daughter, crying her heart out - literally - because as she approached her office, her 2010 Honda Accord EX Coupe had just came to a crunching halt. She had to get help from her staff to push the car into the recreation center where she works. I could feel her tears as she went on and on over the fact that she is in trouble and looking for help from dear old Dad.

She told me she was having her car towed to her mechanic's garage to see what could be done. I suggested that she have the car towed to her local Honda Dealership since, as she described what happened to me over the phone, it sounded like either her engine gave out or that something was wrong with the transaxle. She followed my advice and had the car towed to the Honda dealer. I told her I would help her and, after showering and shaving, I drove up to her work and picked her up.

I drove her to her apartment so she could pick up the title to the Honda Accord EX Coupe, her checkbook (which had enough in the account to pay for a nice dinner at Morton's Steakhouse, but not a penny more, and her insurance paper work. I then drove her to the Honda Dealer. She tried out several models and finally landed on a Honda Civic EX Coupe in white with black cloth interior. MSRP was about $24,455 which included shipping. Edmund's stated that the average purchase price was $22,908. Then they added dealers fee of $999, tinting, pinstriping, and a bunch of other BS add-ons for $1800, 7% sales tax (6% + $50.00), DMV stuff, etc., and came up with a price out the door of $27,990. I told them I would give them one price - if they met that price we would buy the car - if not, we walk. My offer was $26,000 out the door. They argued that I was not paying for the dealer fee or the add-ons and wanted the car for dead invoice. I responded ""YES""! After about 20 minutes, he came back and said they couldn't meet my price. Their counter offer was for $26,001.00. They were being cute.

Now that we had arrived at a sales price, we needed to find out if she could finance the car. Her credit history is a bit tarnished - I'm being positive here and that was the best way I could describe her FICO score - so they came up with a 6.1% 75 month loan with Wells Fargo, the only bank willing to finance her purchase. Since she keeps a car for many, many years, she also wanted an extended warranty - so through Berkshire-Hathaway, we added a 6 year 100,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty (3 additional years over and above what Honda Warrants) with no deductibles and no exclusions. Honda dealership accepts that insurance up to $5,000 on a consignment basis. Honda didn't offer an extended warranty on this car. So, we added $1700 for the warranty and she ended up with a payment of $329 a month.

Needless to say, I am exhausted from all the rushing around. I really hated the fact that that dealership had leg up on getting a deal done because the broken axled Accord was in their service department and if we didn't buy a new car there, we would have to pay to have it towed somewhere else.

All in all, it was an experience I never, ever want to go through again for the rest of my life. Besides, It cost me $8000 which is $8000 less I have in reserve and $8000 less the kids will inherit.

There's a similarity between the bikes with loud pipes and the dangerous driving types to the drivers of usually Hondas with fart can or no can exhausts, primer paint, and dangerous driving habits of cutting in and out and zooming through lights at the end of the yellow.

Interestingly, decades ago I noticed the same characteristics in the Volkswagen drivers in their bugs. The would cut in and out because they felt they were smaller and more agile AND they often had loud exhausts, the most flamboyant of those with exhaust pipes sticking up like giant fingers.

I find that hard to believe, especially given the fact that I can go further on a gallon of gas on the bike than any car out there.
Turns out the average motorcycle is 10 times more polluting per mile than a passenger car, light truck or SUV. It seems counter-intuitive, because motorcycles are about twice as fuel-efficient as cars and emit a lot less C02.

So what gives?
Although motorcycles and scooters comprise 3.6 percent of registered vehicles in California and 1 percent of vehicle miles traveled, they account for 10 percent of passenger vehicles' smog-forming emissions.

Motorcycle engines are twice as efficient as automobile engines, so they generally emit less carbon dioxide. But they emit large amounts of nitrogen oxides, which along with hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are measured by state and federal air quality regulators to determine whether vehicles meet emissions rules.

Here is the full article....not scientific enough for some.....believe it or not.

Early in the spring/summer because there were few if any cruise-ins, a few local towns had cruise nights, where cars just cruised the main streets like _I_ used to do back in the 60s. There were several of the loud small Hondas and other with fart can type exhausts, along with several loud pickup trucks. The little cars started getting stopped by the police because of their aggressive driving on the back loop parts of the cruise pattern.

The police were very tolerant of the driving and noise for a few weeks, but some kept pushing it more and more.

It depends on location, make, model, inventory levels, and of course the dealer. We purchased the RDX almost 2 months ago and found it to be a slog with inventory levels and how quickly they were selling cited as factors for the noncompetitive pricing. A deal was worked out in the end but it took our dealer getting a unit back in a dealer trade with their sister store. Otherwise we were making plans to simply turn in the car and go from there.

That's pretty indicative of the stories I'm getting on the lease threads. Inventory is down, so pricing isn't as competitive. Will likely stay that way until new 2021 production cranks up.

It doesn’t bother me that other than the original Doritos are in short supply because I only eat the original flavor. Same with potato chips although on rare occasions I will eat barbecue chips. As for paper towels, when we made our Sam’s run on Saturday we picked up a bundle of those although we still had about a half package of those. Sam’s had quite a few of them but not as many as they did the last time we were there about a month ago.

I guess you can say we got lucky with the lumber prices for the flip since we got all that stuff in the early Spring. But we’ll take the high prices into account when we sell. You don’t think we’re going to discount the price because we were lucky, do ya?

I'm not saying what is right or wrong, just what I'd probably think of if someone actually asked me. I didn't bat an eye when the first post stated jump seat, though, so I obviously don't think about it. lol.

This brings me to another question: are those even legal to sit in anymore when car is in motion? Would I go to jail for child endangerment if I had one and let my kids ride in it?

tough call for me. The dumb SUV driver only affects me when it is near me on the road, while the ridiculously loud bike riders are auditorily assaulting everyone within a half mile. The former, of course, is far more dangerous.

A friend of mine had a '30s Buick businessman's coupe with the rumble seat. He picked up my son in it, one time, and the two boys went riding off in the rumble seat. Probably 12 yrs old. Definitely not safe. I kept seeing the orthodontia bills, if he had to come to a quick stop.

A jump seat is a seat that folds down to sit in.. like in the back of an extended cab pickup, or a troop transport plane.

I was at the Honda dealership over the weekend (powersports not cars) getting some work done on the bike getting her ready for the winter. The place was relatively empty and by that I mean empty of inventory, not nearly as many bikes, quads, watercraft and the like. Talking to the owner he told me that it was hard getting stuff from the manufacturer and that he was selling out of a lot of things. He stated that he wasn't getting his full allotment of inventory, as an example he said that he usually sells over 70 personal watercraft but received less than half of that this year. It's due to the factories being shut down then slowly reopening. On the plus side he said he isn't negotiating on prices and is easily getting MSRP.

I haven't been in a car dealership since I got the BMW so not sure how auto dealers are doing. Any thoughts?
I mentioned over on CCBA that Enterprise has been selling everything for premium prices to dealers. Our wholesale lots are empty, as are the stores. We often deliver a car to customers who have been cooling their heels waiting for us to arrive. We hop out, the renter hops in. There are no cars left to pull out of service.

We don't do any any maintenance on motors of vacuum cleaners, refrigerators or dishwashers. They work and at some point they stop, usually because of either worn bearing, bad electronics, or seals whenever water is involved. None of these items can be considered regular/preventative maintenance, rather they are all repair items with schedule based on lack of the draw. I think some hybrid power may be more prone to repair issues same way, but it would be a design problem (like say bad electronics), not a maintenance item. However, all traditional parts of internal combustion engine and power transmission system will require maintenance same way regular gas car does.
I like the way BMW replaces the torque converter with an electric motor in their PHEV models. I’d think it would simplify some design issues as the IC motor and the electric motor share the complete drivetrain.

I have my son's old college computer in my spare bedroom: HP 190t. I'd ordered it with the best video card at the time, Nvidia 5770? It is an I7 and was almost the top speed application of the I7 at the time. Since he was in physics I bought capability.

We upgraded a couple years later with a video card that would handle the graphic requirements of the games he played. Like cars, those requirements change monthly.

Replaced that with a Microcenter Gaming Powerspec with a good video card when he started working. He just shopped the Powerspec computer line and ended up buying a Dell Alienware computer that was ""on sale."" But the video card was the most important shopping point I saw. He got an Nvidia 2080 Super which can handle almost anything the latest games can make use of.

I think the speed of the video card is more important than the CPU and the motherboard. But he ended up spending $2300 roughly after the discount.

The Powerspec line is Microcenter's gaming computer line. It makes for good browsing because many come with pretty good video cards. The specs also clearly tell you the motherboard used, sometimes hard to find on other branded computers. From shopping 3 years ago for a Powerspec and a quick look as he was shopping this time, I still think Powerspec does a good job of price point meeting with really good parts.

There's a similarity between the bikes with loud pipes and the dangerous driving types to the drivers of usually Hondas with fart can or no can exhausts, primer paint, and dangerous driving habits of cutting in and out and zooming through lights at the end of the yellow.

Interestingly, decades ago I noticed the same characteristics in the Volkswagen drivers in their bugs. They would cut in and out because they felt they were smaller and more agile AND they often had loud exhausts, the most flamboyant of those with exhaust pipes sticking up like giant fingers.

I really don't have any experiences to share that would be of any interest to anyone. My Dad had a tankless water heater (electric) installed about 15 years ago in my condo unit. I've never maintained it nor have I had any difficulties or performance problems in all those years. Actually, I was thinking about the unit a few days ago - I am sure it will give out shortly (within a few months or a year or so) because of its age. Still gives me all the hot water I need and my electric bills are the better for that tankless water heater. If I had a tank water heater, I am sure it would add at least $15.00 - $20.00 a month to my electric bill. I pray that I die before the tankless water heater dies - and I mean that!!!

977,Sep-23,abacomike,"I mentioned a few weeks/months ago that one of my best friends (he just turned 72) is having some real problems in terms of memory and control of some of his bodily functions.

Back in October of last year, he passed out in the shower and ended up breaking his neck/vertebrae at the C3/C4 level. He was hospitalized twice in order to perform work to fuse the vertebrae. He wore a neck brace for 4 months and finally had it removed about 6 months ago.

Back in June of this year, he passed out again in his garage and ended up breaking his left wrist. Back in to the hospital to surgically repair the fractures and he spent 3 weeks in the hospital because he developed a bladder infection which took quite a while to correct - was also on heavy narcotics for a time due to the pain. He was released to a rehab facility where he spent 6 weeks. He had lost control of his bladder and eventually lost control of his bowl movements requiring diapers.

Now, he uses a walker to get from one room in his house to another and has had limited improvement in his gross motor muscles - i.e. walking, standing, sitting, etc. His memory is getting pretty bad and, in my opinion, he is deteriorating right before our eyes.

I remember my Dad had memory and verbal limitations when he had ""onset"" Altzheimers, which I think is what is happening to my friend. Just think - 10 months ago he was an active man who was fun to be around. In the last 10-11 months, he has deteriorated quickly. Those loss of consciousness episodes were probably mini strokes that have accelerated his memory loss and control of bodily functions. This serves as a ""heads-up"" for me to relish the days and weeks and months we possess all our functions and capacities and mental faculties. You never know when you'll be hit with a deteriorating mental and physical capacity - troubling, to be sure!

My Dad has a Navien tankless in his house. The 2 most important things about the tankless heaters are to make sure they are properly vented. A lot of installers don’t install exactly how the manufacturer specifies and that leads to problems down the road.

As far as maintenance goes, you should have a de-scaler run through the system to have any gunk that’s built up flushed out.

Back in 2006 nat gas was installed in my street and I needed a new furnace anyway so I got a gas one, no complaints there. At the time I was renting a water heater from the furnace oil supplier I had been using so this was the time to change it out. I thought a tankless gas unit was the way to go. At the time though, perhaps because they were still pretty uncommon around here, most suppliers were pretty down on them. The main complaint I heard at the time was that they required such an intense use of energy to get the water hot in a short period of time that they were hard on the unit itself and as a result tended to have lots of problems. That combined with the large cost drove me away from it. I still like the concept though and hopefully the tech and build quality has increased since then.

In theory, no. Batteries wearing out are most obvious huge expense. And electric motors can certainly fail, but should not require much maintenance along the way. The rest is electronics and computers. Expensive if they go, but not much to do along the way.

In colder climates like the North East & Ohio, the tankless units don't perform as well when the ground water is 40 degrees. My Dad has a Natural Gas Heater that is set to about 100 degrees.

Our natural gas tank water heater is at the other end of the house from our master bath. Maybe 45-50 feet of pipe away. At one point, I considered putting an individual unit in, just for the master bath. But, then we finished the lower level, and that killed that idea.

All electric usually need much less maintenance on a yearly basis. Electronics are in gas cars too so that’s a wash. Hybrid plug ins do have a gas engine too so you do need oil changes like in a regular gas car.

All in ones have the tower built in...less wires. You can get a wireless printer, copier scanner for $60 to $100 that hooks up easily.

The one disadvantage could be if the monitor goes or the guts go...you lose both.....but, that isn't going to happen too often. But for some people, advantages far outweigh disadvantages...easy set up, no messy wires.

The thing I would ask myself is....if the average index can outperform the so called experts, then how well can amateurs do?
Some can actually do much better as long as they recognize they play a different game, even though they're occupying same field. There are multiple reasons why many professionally run funds lag indexes, mostly having to do with improperly applied time perspective. For example they have to take phone calls from clients every day and answer idiotic questions like ""what did you do last week to outperform the index? They often are not allowed for their investment thesis to play out due to extended time frame. Imagine you run a fund and you invested in a ""noname"" company that has a potential to make 10x in three years, but it just happened it dropped 30 percent in two months. You will be fired. Peter Lynch once said ""nobody got fired for buying IBM stock"" (not true today, but it was true back then), which basically means if you underperform, but everybody understands why you bought your stuff, then they'll likely let you carry on. This set of limitations will make majority of the fund managers ""closet indexers"", essentially buying ""around"" the index with just a few tweaks here and there (underweight this by by percentage point, overweight that by one, etc.). No swings whatsoever. In that case ye returns will likely be very close to index returns, but there are management fees (for mutual funds charged every day in 1/365 increments). This will make the fund trail the index. Probably by not much, but enough to be noticeable. The situation is even worse in hedge funds that have such high fees that even if you make well over market index, your client may still lag (but who cares, after all you've made your money and that's all that counts).

Individual investors are free from all of these limitations. However, they're not free from having to do real homework on the companies they want to invest in or are already invested, understanding their business, product, financial statements (being able to read income statements and balance sheets, taking time to do so and draw their own conclusions about the business). Show me people who actually do that. Watching CNBC shows with people peddling ideas (and mostly their own image) and telling you should buy this or sell that could count as a small portion of such homework, but many stop there. Then we have now a new ""Robinhood investors"", who can't tell the difference between stocks and bond and think market is an iphone game where Tesla always goes up and buying shares of Hertz after it declared bankruptcy will somehow make you rich.

That pre emergent herbicide works by forming a vapor barrier at the soil line so that any germinating seed gets killed as it tries to grow through it. Since Crabgrass germinates later than lawn grass you can let one grow while the other gets nailed. IIRC Crabgrass germinates when soil temps reach above 50 degrees. That’s why you put it on in the Spring.
Exactly. That's why I over seed early in the Fall to get a good growth before winter and use a pre-emergent in the spring - although I try to time it so any grass that decides to wait and germinate in the Spring makes it. That's why I mentioned the forsythia/lilacs thing previously.

On a different note, I heard a great explanation why TP and towels always go first. They are bulky items, so you see very quickly when the shelf gets empty. Others see it, think they must have it, too. Then the shelves go empty, but the replenishment is not scheduled for days and when it comes it's small amounts, as these manufacturers have logistics set up for normal times, when they know almost exactly how much they'll sell months in advance.

The biggest shortage I’ve seen is in cleaning products. When I go looking for kitchen cleaner all I find are empty shelves. Ditto for all kinds of bleaches and disinfectants. I think people are spraying every surface in an attempt to ward off viruses....or demons, maybe. I think it’s overkill based on panic and while it may reduce the chance of catching a virus by a tiny amount, I can’t help but wonder what sort of super bacteria are evolving on these surfaces. After this is all over I think you’re going to see a surge of bacterial infections that will be immune to standard treatment.

1042,Sep-22,ab348,"QB’s comment about the garage full of paper towels reminded me of a funny anecdote here. A few years ago one of the local TV news operations got the bright idea to do a couponing segment once a week on the 6pm show. The person they picked (or more likely, the one who was pitched to them) was this annoyingly-voiced middle-aged hausfrau who took couponing to an extreme. She would appear each week telling you how to combine multiple offers to get products (many of which I would never buy) for free or close to it. I knew one of the producers at the station slightly at the time and she couldn’t understand why they were so in love with this woman because they all thought she was nuts.

Anyway, one Saturday I’m standing in a long checkout line at a big drug/food/cosmetics store. The lineups were always bad there but this day they were really busy. Up ahead I saw why: a couple with 2 shopping carts full of paper products and other stuff that was on promo, with the coupon lady and her husband rifling though a couple of big expanding file folders stuffed with coupons. It was her. Oh, great. No wonder the line was not moving. A while later my acquaintance sent me a pic that was making the rounds of the TV station that showed the inside of her garage. It had shelves along the walls with a double-wide central shelving unit down the middle. It was stuffed to the rafters with merchandise, a lot of it paper products but also stuff that often went on sale like PB, laundry products or canned goods, more than they could ever possibly use. Unreal.

Thankfully she was dropped from the news show after a few months.

Funny, is a seller's market, you could have told the buyer to pound sand. The lady that sold us our current house kept insisting each time we reported a non-functioning undisclosed item that the item item worked perfectly well, and we just didn't know how to operate an on/off switch correctly (basically, pound sand). Apparently, we didn't know what we were talking about, and she did from 1,000 miles away.

I particularly remember the garage door motor/opener ($$$) and the garbage disposal in the kitchen sink being dead on arrival ($$).

I've had lousy agents. I wish the real estate market for scam artist agents wasn't so strong with the political lobby support so home sales could go more TESLA like.

I see people do crazy stuff like that and there is never a cop around.
My idea is to have unmarked cars on the road with dashcams. Deputies would travel the roads and take video and mark bad drivers....time of the infraction. Drivers (at least the owner of a car) who are caught driving erratically get a $500 ticket. That would stop a lot of bad driving.

If we are going to advocate for ticketing owners rather than offenders, let's not stop there. I say we do criminal charges against the factory workers that helped build the gun that killed someone, and for that matter, the gun store owner that originally owned the gun too.

Law n' order.

I was driving on the interstate this morning, following a SUV at between 65 and 70 mph - in a 65 zone. We both were in the process of passing a left lane camper while going through an interchange.

I looked to my right at the on ramp and saw someone in an old Lexus coming up the ramp. There was nobody behind me for 10 -20 car lengths or more so I figured he would just slide in behind me since I couldn't move over to the left lane.

Wrong! He kept coming, passed me on the right, partially on the shoulder as we were leaving the gore area. Then he cut in front of me, between me and the SUV I was following, then in front of the LLC.

The only problem he had was the car 10 -20 car lengths behind me was a State Trooper. His lights came on immediately...lol.
That cop would have done society 1,000 times better if they had ticketed the original LLC that started all of the problems and chain of events to begin with. Oh well

We were very far along in the process and our purchase almost fell through because the owner was such a tight-behind. We literally were ready to walk away over a couple thousand but I believe the agents conspired to keep the deal alive by taking a tiny chunk of their commissions and putting into the deal so that our immovable lines in the sand were not a couple thousand apart.

I hated my first and last name so made it a point that our kids would have different names that most others and one's that kid's wouldn't make fun of. I wanted ""A. J."" for his nickname but ended up with Drew. So now, we all call him Drew but he uses Andrew with most others. When he was at Duke's TIP Program as a kid, someone called him Andy, something we never ever did, but he responded. Do remember he hated his name for a time back in 1992 after hurricane Andrew decimated the Homestead area, just south of us. Kids made fun of him and he hated it!
When I did choose his name, my mom & grandma were angry since I didn't use the initials for my dad's name, since he died just a year before. In the Jewish religion, one can not be named after a living person. On the girls, we used the initials of the folks who they were named after but with Drew, I waned him to be called ""A.J."" and I wasn't budging on that since we both liked Andrew Jason as his legal name. At the bris, sure everyone knows what that is, the moyle gave a short explanation about the naming situation and assured my mom and grandma that only the Hebrew name was important in G-d's eyes, not the English name. After that, they turned very happy and we were able to continue. Drew's Hebrew name is the same as my dad's and he had died a year to the day before so this was a pretty big deal for the whole family. When my sister adopted a son a few months earlier, she did the same thing, but she used both his English and Hebrew name. But for some reason, a bigger deal was made over our son and all I can think is that is was a major loss in the family for my dad to pass at such an early age and also, my grandma took it very hard losing her first born, as she relied very heavily on him for everything! But coming from the old country, it was very common I think.

About a month later, we did the same thing but this time, success! The ad hit the newspaper on Thursday, Friday we got a call to come see it and Saturday while at work, my wife sold it. They came over Sunday with a check and gave us a large down payment. Only problem was, we did this on a whim thinking it would be like the first time. But, it wasn't. It was the end of February and the only stipulation in the contract was that we'd have to be out a week before Easter. We both said sure but there was one problem. We had no new place lined up! And turns out, Drew was on the way but I was the only one who had no clue about that!

I'm not sure if the market in our area is as strong as where you are but I know it is pretty good. That being the case Son #1 better get to swinging his paint brush to do all the closets in the flip. He has already used his spray gun to do the fist floor of the ranch in a light gray color but he wants the closets to be white. Don't ask me why he wants white in the closets. Once he had that spray contraption going he should have done all the walls with the light gray. And while he's at it he better install the kitchen cabinets too. Then the flip will be ready for market. Oh wait, I just remembered this, he has to install a new front door but that will only take about 45 minutes. I'm anxious to see how the bidding goes.

We were going to let it go another day, but if it went for much more it probably wouldn’t appraise so we felt it was best to take the offer.

As it stands now if it doesn’t appraise the buyer will come up to 10K cash to cover the delta. That made us happy and one of the reasons we took their offer.

They also are closing on their current place this week so all in all a solid buyer.

The cherry on top is they want the old pool table in the basement so I don’t have to worry about it! I’ve moved it three times (bar to friends, friends to cousin, cousin to me) and vowed never to do it again.

I don’t know of anyone that goes to CFA as often as you do. It ain’t health food ya know. Do you own stock in CFA or do you own chicken farms that supplies them?

jmonroe

Thank you for asking. And Amazoom did deliver the replacement hard drive correctly as far as shipping connections. All the way from Portland to here overnight. And this one had a working SATA line.

My wife is able to eat chicken rather than red meats. So the various chicken options at CFA allow variety and I can get many various items I like as well including the Cobb salad with the chopped up CFA deep fried filet. You can option the Cobb salad with other chicken preps.

I wish I'd bought stock in it--the owner has a couple of neat Corvettes he drives, tomato red and black. I don't recall the exact model but they're upline models. Actually the company is privately owned. But this local franchis owner is a great businessman and makes his store work. His employees are very happy and effective. When I occasionally visit other stores, the difference in management style shows in the workers.

There are occasional problems and almost any of the staff take ownership right away and fix them, both when the inside store was operating and now that it's all drive thru.

That is stupendous! I wonder if you had listed it for $20,000 more that you would get it sold almost as quickly. I would think that if it sold that quickly (18 hours) that it would probably have sold for even more - but that's water under the bridge - the fact that this is now history must be a great relief to you and the family. Lots of luck.
Maybe not. Where my kids live it’s a hot market, but ones priced too high still sit awhile. Sounds like your agent priced it right for a quick sale. Well done!

That pre emergent herbicide works by forming a vapor barrier at the soil line so that any germinating seed gets killed as it tries to grow through it. Since Crabgrass germinates later than lawn grass you can let one grow while the other gets nailed. IIRC Crabgrass germinates when soil temps reach above 50 degrees. That’s why you put it on in the Spring.

No, I am not talking about politics or social/moral issues, I am talking about lawn turf. Two specific instances literally popped up recently that have me a bit baffled.

My new front lawn is looking very good 2-3 months after being done over with sods which I believe are mainly bluegrass. A few weeks after they went in I noticed a few different-looking sprouts popping up, most of them on the edges of walkways and the like. They looked like they could have been a different species of grass - clumps of blades that spread out horizontally but with a thick, somewhat tough center stem with a grasslike blade/seed head on top. Each of them spread enough over the walkway that they became unsightly so I pulled them out (quite easily) and they have not returned. I am unsure if they were some kind of rogue grass species or just a weed. Odd that they only came in on the edges which makes me think they were some sort of seed that was in the topsoil the crew put down. Just a curiosity.

On the strip between the sidewalk and the street I had spread some dirt back in the spring and spread some Scott's ""Tough"" grass seed mix, which I understand is mostly some sort of new hardy fescue variety. What came in first looked like no fescue I ever saw with a short, wide blade of very bright green grass that never grew more than 3"" long or so. But more recently a new entrant has appeared. It is extremely fine, almost hair-like, very reddish in color, maybe 6""-8"" tall, and will lie almost flat if you step on it or run a lawnmower wheel over it. Weird.
The first one sounds like Crabgrass. That ‘tough’ grass might be tall fescue which is used on sports fields but isn’t the most attractive. The fine grass almost sounds like fine fescue but that doesn’t have a red color.

Crabgrass grows where you live. In the spring it will look like you don't have any in your lawn, but the seeds are still there and will germinate a little later than the grass. It will grow along a strip of grass because the wind will blow seeds along until they get trapped by the grass.

It's tough to control. Pulling it out when you see it is the best way. Normally, when it is all through a lawn, that is an impossible job. A pre-emergent should be applied early in the spring.

Does it look like one of these?




The reddish grass I am not familiar with. The thin blades sounds like a fescue of some sort. There is a disease known as red thread disease that affects some grasses.

What grew first may have been an annual grass, like ryegrass, to establish the lawn (get you out of the mud) before the regular grass had time to germinate.

They had put an asphalt patch across 1 or both lanes about every 150 feet. They had repaired weak or bad spots in the pavement layers underneath.

So the car was constantly hitting those little waves. Continual impacts at 70 mph. I can see why drivers, travelling nearer Dayton where the interstate is past the section hopefully getting repaved, hence the patching or weak spots, are irritable and speeding at ridiculous speeds. That constant pounding on anything but cars able to absorb the impact and the sounds is wearing.

Imagine what it's like for the semi drivers with 30 miles of that.

I hate AWD systems that are FWD most of the time and only send power to the rear when the AWD system thinks disaster is imminent. For me its RWD in anything bigger than a Civic or Golf. It doesn't help that what passes for ""styling"" is ungainly, but I'm sure it will attract more wearers to the marque. Joy- as if there weren't far too many already.

So anyway, in Europe a 1 Series hatch is available Still no styling triumph but at least it doesn't cause you to cringe like the 2 GC does. Anyway, BMW decided to build a proper hot hatch based on the FWD iteration of that platform- the 128ti. It's priced less than the 8th generation GTI, and I've checked out a couple of British mags that prefer it to the new Golf. A 6.2 0-60 is hardly exciting, but I'll bet it would make a fun daily commuter. It will neve see the light of day in the US, unfortunately- even though it would make a great entry level car that would likely attract enthusiasts rather than poseurs.

A car like that isn't made for the interstate, it's made for back country roads that has plenty of hills and curves, downshifting into curves, punching it coming out of curves and the like. It needs the hairpin, the serpentine and the deviation curves. Interstates are boring, that's not a boring car.

We had about 10000 inventory items and had no good way to keep track of them so made the big decision to buy an IBM System/34 computer system to do the job. IIRC the original things we got from IBM were in the range of $100K. I don't recall if we leased it or bought it.

By mid-1980 we needed the system expanded, and ordered about $60K worth of upgrades. IBM warned us that lead times were months out, but we placed the order and arranged for financing from the same group we used initially. Finally in late '80 or early '81 IBM told us the items were ready for shipment and it fell to me to contact the finance outfit to tell them we would need the pre-approved financing in a week or two. They guy told me that it had been such a long time that the rate had changed - I can't recall it exactly but remember it was in the vicinity of 20%. The boss went nuts. I don't recall if he found another source or if he ended up biting the bullet, but we got the gear.

I bought my house in '97 for $112,000. Mortgage initially was somewhere around 5% IIRC (the papers are here somewhere). Renewed it a few times over the years and still had a chunk owing in 2008 when rates started to plummet. I was luckily on a variable rate mortgage at the time and kept getting notices in the mail every couple of months that the rate had dropped. IIRC the lowest it got down to was 0.8%.

I like many aspects of where I live now, but I moved here for work, and once that ended, I didn't have anything formal keeping me here. I'll miss seeing some friends as often, my beer league hockey team (which ended early and hasn't met in 6 months anyway), but I won't miss the traffic and rat race aspects of the era. I'll be further from some family, closer to some others, but it is only an hour flight and I have a lot of air miles, if I don't want the 4 hour drive.

The car moving strategy is undecided. Storage rent is paid up through January, but I'd like to move it sooner than later as the weather can be risky by November. An old co-worker already volunteered her boyfriend's flatbed trailer (he hauls an excavator with it) and Dodge Cummins truck to help, but it might be a fun adventure to drive the car myself, take highway 2 and have a scenic drive with light traffic and no speed limits over 60. Almost ~275 mile drive including a mountain pass in an unrestored nearly 60 year old car, could be fun. I'd ask my indy mechanic (someone else I will miss) to give it a look over before I go.

His commercials always start with a quick paced tragedy (car accidents, work place accidents, cars in the workplace accidents) and rely on the imagery of a junkyard dog lawyer which have spawned some imitators on youtube. The video I watched suggested a ""What If?"" theme:
What if he were a....Family Counselor? ""I don't get paid unless you get your way!""
What if he were a....Matchmaker? ""I don't get paid unless you get _______!""

I kinda miss the old days with Fred Ricart playing his guitar and boasting about his Used Car Factory! He actually had some legal issues arise from some consumer protection group which blasted Fred for lying to consumers in those commercials. They accused him of misrepresenting his used cars as being built at a factory, thus inferring that they were ""new"" cars instead of ""used.""

Fill a 20 yard dumpster with furniture and other things we weren't bringing to the new house
Touch up all the cinderblock walls in the basement
Pack everything we are taking that's in the basement
Thin down and pack extra stuff that was in our closets
Take down all the personal pictures
Painted the shutters outside
Painted three doors and all the trim in our bedroom
Planted mums and re-mulched the front planting bed
Numerous other little things

We had the basement and all the windows cleaned today, and the crew is deep cleaning the whole place tomorrow. Pictures on Friday.

We escaped to the shore since we are both WFH and the kids are remote Thurs and Fri

Now to decide on if I want to live near work (office, once things are a little more normal, is in a somewhat outlying district) or live in the city and have a slightly longer commute. Rents, as expected, are amusing - I can get more than twice my current square footage for less money, or something the size of my current place for around half.

Thanks, sda. It does have 4 settings:

Economy
Comfort
Sport
Sport +1

I keep it in Comfort around town and Economy on the highway. Economy is Comfort with faster gear shifts. But even in Comfort or Economy, it is still stiffer than I like it - because it is built on a lowered suspension (called AMG suspension) compared to the E350.

I really like the handling and cornering of the E450 4MATIC - it's very responsive to driver input. But to acquire that handling, they had to stiffen the suspension.

1216,Sep-19,ab348,"The world is forever changing and as one gets older it becomes more and more difficult to understand.

No, I am not talking about politics or social/moral issues, I am talking about lawn turf. Two specific instances literally popped up recently that have me a bit baffled.

My new front lawn is looking very good 2-3 months after being done over with sods which I believe are mainly bluegrass. A few weeks after they went in I noticed a few different-looking sprouts popping up, most of them on the edges of walkways and the like. They looked like they could have been a different species of grass - clumps of blades that spread out horizontally but with a thick, somewhat tough center stem with a grasslike blade/seed head on top. Each of them spread enough over the walkway that they became unsightly so I pulled them out (quite easily) and they have not returned. I am unsure if they were some kind of rogue grass species or just a weed. Odd that they only came in on the edges which makes me think they were some sort of seed that was in the topsoil the crew put down. Just a curiosity.

On the strip between the sidewalk and the street I had spread some dirt back in the spring and spread some Scott's ""Tough"" grass seed mix, which I understand is mostly some sort of new hardy fescue variety. What came in first looked like no fescue I ever saw with a short, wide blade of very bright green grass that never grew more than 3"" long or so. But more recently a new entrant has appeared. It is extremely fine, almost hair-like, very reddish in color, maybe 6""-8"" tall, and will lie almost flat if you step on it or run a lawnmower wheel over it. Weird.

Those lots were not released for sale at the time but the sales lady told us that they would be released for sale the next day (first day of the work week) along with a $3K across the board price increase on all the home models. We mentioned that we would come by the next day to get pick a lot and get the process rolling. The sales lady told us that they would release the lot of our choice for sale that day so we could get the lot we wanted and avoid the price increase.

Back in 1979 when we started looking at houses the prices were going up $1000 a month. That might not seem as extreme but this was on houses with $25k prices. At the time inflation was 20% a year for everything else and mortgage rates were in the 10% range.

We kept losing ground to the point where by 1981 we bought land and built our own. Even with sweat equity it cost us $45k fora $30k house.

1243,Sep-18,graphicguy,"Well....file this in the “I never thought it would happen to me” dept.

Was dropping off some fliers touting my little transport business to the Land Rover/Jaguar dealership yesterday afternoon. Didn’t get to see the Owner, GM or SM (which are the only people who can authorize me to do transports in my experience). So, I left them with the Exec Assistant (the person who greets you as you walk into the door). She willingly gave me management’s cell numbers. Follow up is key as I found the only way to jog their memory is to call them and let them know that they can hire a “mature and responsible” person to do their transports.

Walking back to my car, one of the sales people was doing a walk around on the Stinger. “You trading this?” Nope. Explained to him who I was and what I was doing. He was very interested in the Stinger. He sat in it. I lifted the hood. We talked about how much I liked it. He was probably in his mid-late 30s. He gave me his card and told me to let him know if I wanted to move up to a “Jag-u-ar” (his term).

I got in. Took off to a “zip-crunch”. I thought...”oh, s#!t, I just hit a new high buck car that’s going to raise my rates......REALLY HIGH”!

Looked in the rear view...either side of the car....straight ahead...not a car in sight. Now, I thought I ran over something that’s not going to be covered out of warranty.

None of that.....I have a phone holder/pocket on the outside of my briefcase. I guess, being distracted by the sales person, I didn’t put it all the way in the pocket. It dropped out as I was putting the briefcase in the passenger footwell. How I missed the phone dropping is something I can’t figure out. But, I guess I was just not paying enough attention.

Well, the drop would not have hurt it. But, driving over it certainly did. Screen cracked....AND....it would not boot up.

Apple store was relatively close to the nearest mall. Get there....CLOSED...By Appointment only. But, there was an Apple employee at the door who was waiting for people who had an appointment. So, it’s only open by appointment. They were all booked up until today. Trying to eek a little sympathy, I showed the employees the pieces of my iPhone 10. They all have their proverbial iPads on them. He looked up my account. “You’re the kind of customer we like. Looks like you have an iPad, a MacBook Pro, a Mac and your iPhone”. Looking at my iPhone, “we’re not going to be able to fix that.”

I knew that. He asked if I would be willing to take a refurbished iPhone. “I am”. He said since I was a long time Apple customer in the Apple ecosystem, they’d give me a trade in amount (good condition rating...WOW!) on my broken iPhone for an iPhone 11 (mine’s an 8). Couldn’t get it last night as they were all booked. But, have an appointment today to go pick it up.

This is one of the many reasons I like doing business with Apple.

Not me. I think auto pilot is a very dangerous feature that shouldn't be allowed in automobiles. The whole theory of a human ""taking over"" when needed is flawed on a fundamental basis.

Automated driving is accumulating many murders, including a lady pedestrian in AZ last year I think it was (Google Uber Autonomous Driving).

Therefore: Deaths from Autonomous Driving (XXX and rising)/miles driven is > Deaths from @andres3 speeding/miles driven while speeding. And I'll wager huge sums of money that > (greater than) relationship in that equation will always be true for my lifetime.

We bought our first house for $25k in 1979. Two banks in our town failed. The seller had to finance the sale himself, interest rates something like 17%. Looking back it’s a miracle that we didn’t lose our shirts. Turns out the seller did. The way he set up the loan he wound up paying extra. I still don’t understand it. We were so glad to get out of that situation a few years later and buy a larger house when conventional mortgages were normal again.

We kept losing ground to the point where by 1981 we bought land and built our own. Even with sweat equity it cost us $45k fora $30k house.
Our first house was a new build in 1969 it cost just a tick under $22,500 (a split entry with around 1300 sq. ft. with a 2 car garage). The interest rate was 7%. When I finally thought I made enough in the early 80’s to buy a bigger house, interest rates were going through the roof so I decided to stay put and buy a couple CD’s instead. Turned out to be a good decision. I think it was about 1982 or 1983 when I worked with a guy who had cold sweats about a week before his variable rate interest on his home loan would be announced. I’m pretty sure he paid 17% at one point. I’m glad I never fell for that pitch that real estate people were passing out back then. I told Mrs. j when the interest rates dropped to 10% or lower we could go looking for another house. Finally at the end of 1988 I got a 9.25% loan so we bought and closed in January of 1989. By then both of my sons were off at school and we really didn’t need more space at that time but we made a promise to ourselves when the time was right we’d do it. Even then I thought with two kids off to school that didn’t quite seem like the right thing to do but we held to our promise. The CD’s really helped. I wasn’t good, just lucky.

That would have been terrifying, and interesting, at the same time. I think the trial went on for some months, and he was acquitted of some charges and found guilty of others. The same jury then had to determine sentencing, and they deadlocked.

Big companies are being extra cautious these days....too many insurance and property scams. When I changed insurance companies (car and home) they are going to send out an appraiser - FOR HOME INSURANCE! Can't they see it on google? They asked a dozen questions, have you ever been convicted of insurance fraud, how many claims have you made in the last 6 years, how old is your roof, does your sump pump have batteries.....?

We aren't really in a flood plain area because we are on the side of a small mountain, so any water build up will go over the edge.

We lived in the country - that is when we had a rifle - on 99 acres. I really resented paying taxes on all that land (we got a big reduction letting a farmer use a portion), so I wanted my next house to have a good view, but not a lot of property that I would pay tax on....this way I can see for miles and not pay taxes on it!

For the kind of money you guys on the West Coast are seeing houses sell for, you can live in very nice houses in the very nicest neighborhoods in and around Ohio and Kentucky. I’ve got a 3,000 sq ft house with 4 BRs, 3 full and one ½ bath, modern mechanicals, on a nice sized lot, in a cul-de-sac in a relatively nice and quiet suburb that will sell for $300K-$325K. It’s move in ready.

We’re already in the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression. So, whomever gets elected here next, has nowhere to go but up. And, I won’t take investment advice from someone who isn’t certified to give it.

I think the old adage applies. Don’t buy high and sell low (which is what’s bound to happen in today’s real estate market).

Back to cars...am I the only one who doesn’t think the 400Z that’s coming out looks good? I don’t like it. Given a choice, I’d buy the Infiniti Q50 Red over the 400Z (which is going to be a clone of).
I don’t have strong feelings either way. I still kind of like the 370Z- in fact I’d probably buy one if the telematics were a bit more up to date. Then there’s the question of Nissan’s long term viability.

1304,Sep-17,roadburner,"On another vehicular topic, I often follow the forums dealing with cars I’m considering purchasing. As an example, the Giulia forums keep my desire for that car at bay- new cars missing a complete wiring harness anyone?
Anyway, the Stinger forum had a recent post from a guy who took his Stinger in for service and then found greasy fingerprints and red shop rag lint all over his car’s dash and glove box- apparently left by the alleged “technician” who replaced the cabin filter. I know that most all of the local Ford and VW dealers refuse to employ techs with opposable thumbs and I fear that the Kia dealers utilize a similar hiring policy. It’s a real concern since I’ve been exchanging emails with a NCM at one of the local Kia dealers who really wants to sell me a RWD Stinger GT2.

I like the new Z for its lack of overstyling - the big rectangular mouth isn't the best theme, but the Z32 rear light cluster is cool. Still, not something on my list.

The 350/370 is nearly 2 feet shorter than the Mustang. The 400 is growing some but only to the same length as the Supra. The compact size is why I preferred the driving dynamics of my 350 to my stang GT. But I had an early lighter 350.

We jumped into buying a new home right now for a few reasons.

1: the value of our home is very high right now
2: we have significant equity in it.
3: interest rates are crazy low.
4: we are in our home more than ever and wanted the extra space.

The home we are buying was built two years ago for $15,000 less than we are paying so we didn’t do too bad. New home prices (which we originally wanted are going to skyrocket with the costs of raw materials going through the roof)

Neither have I, I think it’s a carrier. Mine is Spectrum, very cheap , only $14/month with 1 GB of data (usually enough for my daily routine between wifi spots at home and work), but it has no spam protections. I even get those annoying text spams messages without ability to block them. I don’t bother to block individual numbers, as those are spoofed anyway.
I have something similar to yours. I have ""xfinity mobil"" which is $12.00 a month plus tax or about $13.45 a month for 1 gig of data. If you go over 1 gig of data, it's another $12.00 for each partial gig or full gig over the 1 gig included with the service. You can convert to unlimited data for $45.00 a month plus tax, but since I am always on WiFi with some brief exceptions (like in the car), I usually don't use more than 100-300 megs of data a month. You have to have Xfinity (Comcast) internet service as well as cable TV in order to qualify for the pricing. They use Verison towers for their service, so the quality is as good as Tmobil, AT&T, etc.

I have an Apple 8+ but neither the phone or the carrier alert me to spam calls.

I went into MB service and they tested the starter battery and the regular accessory battery and both were fine. They checked the alternator and that too was fine. So they had to do a full reset because the warning light refused to go out.

If the warning light comes on again, they will need to have the car brought back so they can try to further diagnose it. It did not come back on after the reset.

BTW, I was at the Apple Store because I was having problems with my iPhone 8+ speakers and microphone. After doing diagnostics, they found the speakers and microphone to be defective. Luckily I had Apple Care + on the phone. Do they replaced it with a new iPhone 8+. Apple sure does a great job in backing their products.

I have been officially and really retired since early 2015 (as opposed to being officially retired as far as my employer was concerned since the first of 1997 but worked as a consultant with them till 2015). Anyway, this was at a very large engineering company and they had a pretty sophisticated phone block blocking system but sometimes a pretty sophisticated bad guy got through their system. One day not too long before I retired I got a call from one of those extended warranty companies. As soon as I picked up the phone the caller was there (didn’t have the typical delay as those calls usually have). When I told the guy I just bought a car and had a 5 year bumper to bumper warranty (I lied just to get rid of him), the guy didn’t miss a beat and immediately said, “no problem, we can extend it beyond that”. I think a lot of these extended warranty company people would have been a little surprised by my response and would have paused for a second or two before giving me their pitch. When I think back on that call I shouldn’t have been too surprised because if that company could crack the phone blocking code of my company, they probably had callers that were a cut above the run of the mill outfits.

FWIW, I think the caller ID that can be displayed on your TV, if you elect to do that, is just a notch below a DVR on the ‘better than sliced bread curve’.

Another FWIW, when I’m not watching TV and I get a call, I never say, “hello” twice. When you call and I answer you better not studder because I’ll have hung up by then. Everyone in my family knows this and are prepared to speak immediately when I answer. Mrs. j has often said I’m a very impatient person. I’ll take that since that’s one the nicer things she has said about me.

We live in a 2400 sqft home where we only use half the house so several years ago we decided to down size. To get a decent house and make it worth the move we would have to move into a much smaller townhome. But then again I live an area where the home that Fintail showed would be one quarter that price.

I have been officially and really retired since early 2015 (as opposed to being officially retired as far as my employer was concerned since the first of 1997 but worked as a consultant with them till 2015). Anyway, this was at a very large engineering company and they had a pretty sophisticated phone block blocking system but sometimes a pretty sophisticated bad guy got through their system. One day not too long before I retired I got a call from one of those extended warranty companies. As soon as I picked up the phone the caller was there (didn’t have the typical delay as those calls usually have). When I told the guy I just bought a car and had a 5 year bumper to bumper warranty (I lied just to get rid of him), the guy didn’t miss a beat and immediately said, “no problem, we can extend it beyond that”. I think a lot of these extended warranty company people would have been a little surprised by my response and would have paused for a second or two before giving me their pitch. When I think back on that call I shouldn’t have been too surprised because if that company could crack the phone blocking code of my company, they probably had callers that were a cut above the run of the mill outfits.

FWIW, I think the caller ID that can be displayed on your TV, if you elect to do that, is just a notch below a DVR on the ‘better than sliced bread curve’.

Another FWIW, when I’m not watching TV and I get a call, I never say, “hello” twice. When you call and I answer you better not studder because I’ll have hung up by then. Everyone in my family knows this and are prepared to speak immediately when I answer. Mrs. j has often said I’m a very impatient person. I’ll take that since that’s one the nicer things she has said about me.

I find those telemarketers as frustrating as anybody but I feel a little sorry for them too. Many of them are down on their luck individuals who are only working these jobs because no one else will hire them.

My autistic son did a similar job as a survey caller for the phone company. They hired a lot of people with disabilities through vocational rehabilitation. He was only able to tolerate the abuse for a couple of months even though he wasn’t selling anything.

A woman who I used to work with had a drug addicted daughter who took one of those warranty telemarketing jobs during a brief period of sobriety. She eventually relapsed and died of an overdose. Did the stress get to her? Who knows.

Because of that I try not to answer those calls when they come up on caller ID. If I get fooled into answering I hang up immediately before the live person comes on the line. There might be some professional scammers working these promotions but I’d rather not risk making some unfortunate person’s life any tougher.

That's why I like my Sentry on my landline: I get NO rings that I have to answer. Not even 1 ring like some block setups. Most of the calls that I have answered that were telemarketers were computerized voices or recordings. Their ""agents"" were talking to other people, not waiting on mine to answer. 9 out of 10 calls that I have answered in the last year have hung up on me because the computer apparently doesn't have a live person to which I can be connected. I say, ""Hello."" And ""Hello"" again. Then click.

I'd like to have a good system for my Samsung Galaxy J7 Crown cell phone. But I just don't answer even if the call has the same area code and prefix as my cell--which is a rare prefix around here for cell or VOIP-based phones. If it's important, they'll leave a message or call back again hoping they had the wrong number. I'd like a way of blocking group calls based on prefix.

Even though my condo needs updating, because it's located a block from our theatre and the country club, it would sell in a week or two. Most out of state buyers update the condos in my community anyway - new flooring, new kitchen, new bathrooms, etc.

But even though I would walk away with $150,000, where am I going to live here in Florida for $516 a month (HOA monthly fee)? Nowhere! I would need a $100,000 mortgage in a new place. So I decided to live out my life here. If I have to put in two new bathrooms 🚽 an a new kitchen and redo the flooring ($25,000 - $30,000) it would be more economical to remain here.

My mom has a crony who has gone that route, and I have dropped hints she should look into it (no dice so far, she has too much stuff).

Back when I lived in a condo, the HOA was only like $150, this was in the early 00s and the association had plenty in reserve. Many I see locally are as much or more than yours, not sure where some of the money goes as they aren't fancy buildings.

Just speculation, there's no way of knowing short of a comprehensive oil analysis.
In any event, he believes that adding Liqui Moly Motor Oil Saver might help prevent gaskets from hardening and leaking- and before you ask, no, my dealer does not sell Liqui Moly products. Anyway, my SA noed that he had dropped some used N62 valve seals in a glass of Motor Oil Saver and after a few days they became as pliant as new seals.
So, I've decided to see how the product works in the Club Sport and the Clubman. The Club Sport has a slight oil seep at the front oil seal and the Cooper is all dry for now. It's inexpensive at $7.68 a can delivered from FCP Euro. Both cars get annual oil changes so we will see what happens.

If you were to get pulled over by Kentucky's finest while doing 90+, would you pull out your Commonwealth Attorneys ID card and expect to get professional courtesy, or would you suck it up and pay the fine like the other 99% of the population?
I don’t even carry my Commonwealth’s Attorney ID with me unless I’m going to another court or to the State Capitol- and that’s only because it allows me to skip standing in line for the metal detector.
I rely on situational awareness to avoid being pulled over in the first place. For example, when I was hitting 90+ I was in the right lane of an interstate in broad daylight where cars were passing me on a continual basis. I wasn’t driving that speed just to be doing it- I was literally keeping up with traffic.

Since I’ve owned my first house I have ALWAYS turned off the water and relieved the pressure when I was going to be out of the house for more than a day. It’s very easy to do. Don’t worry, if you forget to turn it on when you get home you’ll be reminded pretty quickly. When you think about it, it’s pretty fool prove. The last thing I want to see when I get home from vacation is water running out from under my garage door. I’ve mentioned this before and I’m sure you guys have laughed but I have trained Mrs. j to turn off the water supply to the washing machine and bleed off the pressure after every use and to double check it before going to bed. Yes, I am paranoid about things like this. Kinda like checking lug nuts when I take my car to a shop and they work anywhere near my wheels.

This won’t help with breakins but it never hurts to do what you have control of.

I noticed it seems to be common policy (at least in Canada these days), to have a clause they slide in that says someone has to check the house every 3 days if you are away. Not sure if that is standard and happening in the U.S., but, I bet most people don't know about that clause. We don't have time but I am going to see before next October if any companies don't have that requirement.

I think they would want to ask someone....also if they could find 1 weeks worth of damage they would know. I think companies that check keep a log. They could check with our alarm company, as the checker would have a code for the alarm...they can check when they came. It might be hard to get someone to lie for you too.....there may be a serious penalty. If there is $500000 worth of damage they will check everything possible.

I think it’s set up like that as a show off thing. I mentioned some time ago that I followed a beat up Civic on the NY Thruway that was cambered just like that and he was doing 40 mph as chunks of his tires flung off in every direction. I’m guess it’s a drifting thing.

I just put new tires on the Mustang and since the old ones had maybe 50% tread left I emailed my nephew to ask if he knew anyone who might want them. He responded that he might since a lot of his friends burned up their tires on a regular basis by drifting their cars.

We have always turned the water off as well. They say thieves could clean the place out and have days to do it, flooding from water outside will get worse with time, water coming from the roof......lots can go wrong other than water damage. We go away for 5 months for 10 years...no problems, we turn the water off like you do. The insurance companies are sliding this clause in.

My wife would never shoot anyone, and if she did without her contacts in, would probably be me. So not arming her. I would either shoot my daughter for coming home unannounced or (more likely) put a big hole in the wall that I would have to fix.

we have a big Lab. Useless as a guard dog, but he is a tripping hazard. That would probably bark after the burglar stepped on him.
Just remember that most burglaries happen in the daytime when most homes are empty (something like two thirds), burglars don't want to run into people. Also breaking into a home armed can carry stiffer penalties so most, not all, do the break in unarmed. I read someplace that homeowners come across armed burglars in less that 15% of confrontations.

I agree 100% regarding training and practice; I have set up a target range behind the detached garage. My son was learning and practicing with my handguns by his early teens. His friends also came out to use the range. By his senior year I didn’t even need to supervise them.
Training is essential.
In your training I would suggest ""shoot/don't shoot"" training. Shooting on the range at a target in a controlled situation is a lot different than the uncontrolled unknown situation of coming on an intruder in your home. You really need that ""shoot/don't shoot"" training to be fully trained in these scenarios.

They probably wouldn’t have let you get close enough that you could prove to anyone that it was Air Force One.

As I’ve said before, when I was in the Navy I was in a transport squadron based at Patuxent River Naval Air Test Station in MD. What I don’t think I have said before is when Kennedy’s 707 came out of check, to avoid congesting the airspace in the DC area (Dulles was not built yet. Just had National at the time) his plane headed 60 miles South to our base to do touch-and-go’s. And they probably did at least 10 when they showed up. Our base was shut down to all traffic until they were done and all roads had traffic stopped by the Marines when the plane was about 1 mile out until the plane was about 5K feet in the air after take off.

I remember one time we were coming back to our base after being in the air for about 10 hours on a C-130. The pilot decided not to stop at Quonset Point RI to refuel since he knew he had enough gas to make it to Pax River. Ordinarily that would be fine but one time we got caught in a holding pattern for about 45 minutes due to Air Force One doing its touch-and-go’s. Everyone on board kept looking at the fuel gages. We were OK but we never let the tanks get that low. The pilot was getting disgusted and said, “it’s about time they let us use our own runway, don’t you think”? We held for what turned out to be the last touch-and-go. When we were given the OK to take the runway the pilot said, “what do you think the tower would have said if I told them our tanks were about empty”? The flight engineer said, “they probably would have said we should have stopped at the last gas station and told us to put on our chutes on and aim the plane at the Chesapeake Bay”? We all chuckled but that might not have been so far fetched because nothing and I mean NOTHING got in the way of that plane when it wanted air space.

I got out of bed, the alarm company called, they could tell it was the slider.
I said, what do I do now.......like, what if the guy has a gun?
They said take the phone and walk toward the back slider door.
The door was open but the guy must have taken off when the alarm went off.

Or you could go a little high tech like a friend of mine did in the late ‘70’s. Went to Radio Shack and bought one of those hobby boxes and wired up a few led’s that just turned on and off randomly. The box was powered by a battery charger. He then mounted the box across from the patio door and left the curtains open at night so that a would be intruder could see the dancing lights. He never had a problem like his neighbor did. That intruder took two slugs from a 45 in the leg when he opened the patio door and walked in early one morning. I guess some neighbors are very protective of their homes.

I believe the Sonet is a smaller version of the Seltos. Yes, it is true that the Seltos was designed for the Indian market. That vehicle was so successful in India that Kia expanded sales outside of India, even to the US.

The Sonet, however is not limited to Indian market. It has created a buzz in Malaysia and other sub-continent countries that Kia expects it to be even more successful than Seltos."

I agree 100% regarding training and practice; I have set up a target range behind the detached garage. My son was learning and practicing with my handguns by his early teens. His friends also came out to use the range. By his senior year I didn’t even need to supervise them.

As it was I was held overnight to make sure they weren't seeing a brain bleed on the CT scan, not that I remember much from the amount of Ativan they had to give me in order to stitch the cut just a couple mm from the corner of my eye.

There's a better chance we convert that space to a bathroom since the rough ins are already there. With the boys getting older, having friends over more often, etc. we want that to be a space where they'll have little need to come upstairs for anything haha. There's already a kitchenette so a bathroom would round it out nicely. An under utilized, albeit smaller closet that will store probably 75% of what the current space does, just won't be walk in.

Looks like we are going to dodge another bullet this weekend. There's a tropical depression just east of South Florida moving west that is expected to become a tropical storm as it enters the Gulf of Mexico.

We are forecasted to receive 4-6 inches of rain between late tonight through early Monday morning. Flooding is expected.

Also, there is a disturbance off the African coast expected to become a strong hurricane and is moving toward us. I just hope our luck continues.

Another explanation is that the car was not garaged kept and the owners resided in a heavily dense populated urban area where parking and streets were rather tight. Add that to being in a northern area where it might spend time buried in a snow drift or be covered with city dirt for long periods of time and that could explain the exterior condition.

Another thing to consider that the ad is actually a scam, a low priced, low mileage car that someone just might want to snatch before someone else buys it. Send the seller a payment and the seller, ad, and money disappear.

About phone numbers, I know that scammers will just randomly call numbers. I just recently received a cell phone for work (since most of my time is work from home) that had a new number in a new area code. Less than two weeks later I received a call on it telling me that my cars warranty was about to expire.

Best thing to do with phone numbers is your doing something like selling online or giving out your number to someone you will only need it for a short time is to get something like Google voice and get a number through that and use that, when the number is no longer needed dump the number.

The woman who he lived with that answered the phone said she kicked him out of her place and she was pretty sure he was running from the law now. That was the first guy I called so I called the other guy. Was almost hoping to hear a similar story but he was no longer interested.

This happened to my wife’s Mazda back in the day. I took it to a Mazda dealer in Pittsburgh that shall remain nameless. They left a torque wrench under the hood and slammed the hood down to close it. I found it at pick-up because the hood wasn’t aligned and there was a bump at the back by the windshield. Real Mensa members.

Never had to do it, but the heater core on my 98 leSabre was sitting right there laughing at anyone needing to replace it. I know because I had messed with the computer box that controlled the vacuum feeds to the HVAC airflow box that attached right onto the cover for the heater. Several members of forums had to replace theirs. Hard part was getting the rubber tubes off the engine side because they required a long nosed side plier type device, or lots of fiddling.

The later leSabre 2000-2005 and Bonneville had a modular HVAC box that was reasonably easy to get into for replacing the evaporator core and heater core. But did require unwiring the electrical parts that controlled the air flow and some dash stuff.

Wenonah, Yes we were too, but they needed out ASAP (relocating) and have three small kids. I don't think they wanted to go through the process with tons of showings and all the back and forth. Having an inside track with two Realtors who feed off each other really helped.

We have been looking for months, but only recently got serious. We knew exactly what we wanted. This stretched the budget a bit, but since it's so new we figured it was worth it. It's looking like a 2.75% rate so the extra money we are spending isn't much at all monthly.

Great review - thanks! It is a compelling option for the price point and the reliability. At 26k you start pushing into GTI/GLI territory, but I'd think it is probably a safer bet quality wise.

When Civic Si was leasing in the mid-high 200s, IMO, that was a screaming bargain for a sporty sedan. I'd probably consider jumping on one if those prices ever came back around.
Gladly.

If I were looking for something in that size and price range, I’d probably stack the Civic Si over the GTI. My son loves his GTI. But, even he is now starting to look at a replacement, and he’s looking seriously at the Si.

That’s the first time I had ever driven an Si. Drivetrain, steering, handling was just so good, it’s hard not to take notice given its price tag.

Yes, and first time in my life I'll have a garage! No poles inside it either. Current owners aren't using it for cars, so there is all shelving on either side.

Gladly.

If I were looking for something in that size and price range, I’d probably stack the Civic Si over the GTI. My son loves his GTI. But, even he is now starting to look at a replacement, and he’s looking seriously at the Si.

That’s the first time I had ever driven an Si. Drivetrain, steering, handling was just so good, it’s hard not to take notice given its price tag.

So, was coming back from the Civic transport yesterday and saw a Garage Sale happening close to my cul de sac. Usually, I don't stop at Garage Sales. I don't want/need someone else's clothes or Tupperware.

This one was a little different as it was being held outside an older Victorian house. My neighborhood was a large farm at one point. And, the family that owned the farm sold off parcels for my development. This house belonged to the Patriarch of that family.

More out of curiosity than anything else, I stopped to look.

Lots of large, sometimes antique, furniture. Some old, old tools. I was hoping for antique glassware, but all I found was (still collectible) milk glass. A very old Ford tractor was for sale, too. Apparently the children were tired of storing all of this stuff and was selling what was left of an auction they had a few weeks ago. Lots of stuff I liked, but I'm trying to purge, not acquire.

The chrome tube amp is from a well respected Chinese Audio company. Apparently it slipped through the cracks. This thing can't be much more than a year old. So, someone in the family bought it relatively recently. Point to point hand wiring, which is very unusual for any audio gear these days, which is made mostly from PCBs and machine wiring. Looks to be all hand made. Tubes were still in the factory wrap and in purpose built boxes. Not hugely expensive, but these are still selling on line. $400-$500.

Bought it for $27. It was in what looked to be the same box in shipped in (with the FRAGILE stickers all over it) and was wrapped in the same cloth bag it appeared to be packed with The chassis alone is worth $500 in the U.S. and weighs 20 lbs. The tubes are worth another $500, if they work. The units sold today have cheaper tubes. These tubes are PSVANE E34, which are prized for their sound.

Got it home, checked the wiring. Nothing looked amiss. Plugged in the tubes. Voila...everything works.

This isn't high powered. Looking on line, it's a 12 watt amp. Won't drive inefficient speakers but sounds glorious driving my highly efficient Klipsch Heritage.

Yeah, the GM X-body compacts of the '70s initially had names whose first letters spelled out ""NOVA"" - Nova, Omega, Ventura, Apollo. Never could tell if that was intentional or not. The Omega was a pretty nice car, better-trimmed inside and out than most Novas, and could by had with the Olds Rocket 350, which was perceived as a better engine than the SBC.

Ha Ha you don't forget a thing! On my list to do is get a quote for a moving company!

Thanks!
Hey, I have a suggestion that you might want to look into:

When I knew I was going to be moving back to the Burgh from SC, I started getting some quotes from a couple moving companies. As you can imagine the cost was quite high but I wasn’t going to carry all the furniture and pack it into U-Hauls. When talking to both of my sons one morning I just a mentioned what it was going to cost. They both wanted to know if I was crazy and they both said they were coming down to carry the heavy stuff and pack it into U-Hauls. I told them I didn’t want them carrying that stuff either. But if they could come down and help with the packing that would save me a good bit of money. They argued with me but their mother convinced them to do it my way.

Then I got an idea. I called a large U-Haul place that had one of those storage places too. I asked the guy if he had any guys that he could recommend that could pack U-Hauls for me and he said, “sure, I have a couple guys that do that for people moving all the time”. He gave me their number so I called one of them and he was happy to get some extra money. He said for a house the size I mentioned (almost 3500 sq.ft.) he needed 3 guys, him doing the packing of the furniture and 2 guys to carry it to the trucks (I was going to rent two 26 foot jobs). He said it would take him a day and a half to do the work. His price was $42 an hour for all three guys. I just about fell over when I heard that price because I was being quoted $65 for each guy from the pros and they were going to use 3 guys too for 2 days. OK, that was fine as long as I could find guys to unload it when I got back to the Burgh. Even if I had to pay a good bit more per hour on the Burgh end, I was still going to save a ton by not having professional movers doing it all. More good news, I called one of those manpower places and hired 3 guys to unload the truck on the Burgh end and only had to pay the manpower place $12 per guy per hour. Now this was in August of 1997 but the cost today still has to be a lot less than using professionals for everything. I was very satisfied with the work. There was only one small scratch on the bottom side of the fridge and that would be hidden when it went into the kitchen of the house we eventually bought.

Just something to think about.

I wonder if those two things are related?

It seems that serviceability is not a high priority for many auto manufacturers these days, and not just Ford. For years on many GM cars, replacing a heater core required removing the inner fender, which first meant removing everything that was attached to it and then removing the RF wheel. In some instances it also involved removing the passenger front seat and the glovebox. Now a heater core typically goes a great many years before needing replacing so perhaps that is excusable. But on my ATS, when a headlamp bulb blows and needs replacement a similar wheel/fender liner removal is necessary. I mean, come on. Couldn't they just engineer a little hatch or cover of some sort and let you avoid that?
That’s easy compared to some heater cores. And that Sarah girl on YouTube pointed out on the GTI that there was a little manhole in fender liner to access the fog light bulb. Such a simple thing that so companies skimp on. Looking at you, Mini!

Its really not that remote, only about a mile or so drive from a rather populated area that is pretty much a suburb of Phoenix, AZ (just under 30 miles as the crow flies). As for the interior, you might be right but it could also be a second home for some rich dude that's basically used to house his car collection and the rest of the house is just basic minimalist décor as it is not the main purpose of the house. There are houses nearby, but this house is where it's really thinning out but there are multiple homes within walking distance.
Since you're in that area I'll take your word on it. I was going by the pics which only show desert and mountain vistas, and not much else. I wondered when I first read the listing if the $4 million price included the car collection since there were almost as many pictures of them as there was of the house.

You should try replacing the battery in my Sebring, you have to remove the front drivers side tire and go in through the wheel well.
The first car I had that had A/C was my ‘75 Grand Prix. To get at the number 2 and 4
plugs was almost impossible to do from leaning over the passenger side fender because they were under the A/C compressor and refrigerant lines. After going by feel and dropping the ratchet wrench a half dozen times, at least, I decided to remove the right front tire and going in that way. Once I pushed aside the rubber splash flap that somewhat protected the upper control arm, the plugs were staring me right in the face and were very simple to get at. No more dropped wrenches and scraped nuckles after doing it that way.

In the case of the Sebring it's supposed to protect the battery from engine heat. It does make sense due to heat will reduce the life of a battery. Take it for what it's worth.

That doesn’t surprise me. On the few occasions when I rented a truck they never once asked if I knew how to drive it. Just asked to see a valid drivers license along with a good credit card and then a signature. Easy peezy to rent cars and trucks. That’s why I stay as far away from rental trucks as I can get.

Would love your thoughts on the Civic Si, @graphicguy.

Sure...happy to.

Overall, a fun car, light on its feet, Easy to toss around. Great shifter. Smooth engine that makes typical Honda noises (that's a good thing). Pulls the car well, but upper rev ranges gives more sound than power.

Strong brakes. Steering is precise. Thought it was a little heavy for such a small car, though.

Clutch was light and easy to modulate. Handled quite well, especially given it is FWD.

Nice steering wheel. Feels good and was nice to flip from lock to lock.

Depending on how you feel about the modern safety stuff, it had all of that on it.

Downsides....more hard surfaces than I was expecting. Bolsters on the seats were a little overdone. While it wouldn't bother me, mashing it...I did get a little bit of torque steer.

I little ""ricer"" looking for my taste, both in and out. I know the automotive world is going all digital for Speedo and Tach, but I still prefer a good set of analog gages. Lots of information you can look at, though. I can do the same in my Stinger. But, I rarely use all the other secondary gages. I mean what am I going to do with a turbo boost gage? It's either on, which you'll know. And if it's not offering boost, you'll know that, too. A gage isn't going to help with any of that. Just the slightest turbo lag, but not enough to be worried about as the boost comes on quick.

Still, it's a Honda. And it's a fun one, too. I think the one I drove had around $26K MSRP. For that kind of money, I can't think of a car that offers as much fun. Plus, you're pretty much guaranteed to have a long, fruitful, frugal relationship with it.

One thing I considered, was a 6 speed sport. Going to drive pretty close to an Si. But you have a choice of sport, so relatively stripped, or sport touring, which is loaded but almost $30,000. The Si is actually a better deal.

If they just offered an EX manual, that would be an interesting option. But they don’t.

I test drove a GLI, and really really wanted to like it. But, I noticed the difference in the interior trimming and quality pretty quickly.

Haven't driven an Si - local dealer thinks they are special and won't allow a drive without a buyers order. Nope, sorry, I don't play that. Lots of Honda dealers around where I'm sure I could get a test drive if I wanted one.

I heard Judge Napalitano talking this morning that New Jersey has an exit tax of $10,000 apparently on sale of real estate?

Then later today I saw a Florida plated car loafing around locally--probably an Ohio resident who moved to Florida as main residence to pay no income tax but still lives here much of the year. It used to be people kept their Ohio driver license because it was easy to get renewed despite vision problems. That ended a couple decades ago after an Ohio licensed-driver living in Florida ran through a crosswalk with people in it. They found she wouldn't have passed a real eye test at the DMV. Shortly after Ohio changed their renewal requirements. Sad.
If true that’s very sad. What do they consider an exit?

I am trying to decide when it comes to needing a new battery should I replace it myself, let ""Guy"" replace it or just get rid of the car. It is 13 model years old with almost 150K miles on it, but it is a good winter car.
From a fun perspective, with a broken convertible top I say get rid of it since you have another convertible. From a practical perspective, if it runs it’s worth a battery. Especially if it saves your better cars from winter weather.

I wonder if those two things are related?

It seems that serviceability is not a high priority for many auto manufacturers these days, and not just Ford. For years on many GM cars, replacing a heater core required removing the inner fender, which first meant removing everything that was attached to it and then removing the RF wheel. In some instances it also involved removing the passenger front seat and the glovebox. Now a heater core typically goes a great many years before needing replacing so perhaps that is excusable. But on my ATS, when a headlamp bulb blows and needs replacement a similar wheel/fender liner removal is necessary. I mean, come on. Couldn't they just engineer a little hatch or cover of some sort and let you avoid that?

First a little background:

In 1986 Mrs. j’s aunt wanted to give her oldest great nephew her 1974 Old Omega 2 door sedan, burgundy with the black vinyl top even had A/C that would chill your bones. I didn’t want Son #1 to have a car when he was in high school but the car had just under 24K miles and was in very good condition. I knew that car never saw 3000 RPM so I couldn’t let that car out of the family so he got it (I think @oldfarmer50 would have drooled over that car). Man, that car with it’s GM 350 V8 could really move that small Omega. Another reason why I didn’t want him to have it but I caved in the name a guy who appreciated a nice car. OK, so that’s the background.

When we moved to SC in ‘92 my son had his ‘91 Grand Prix that he bought when he got out of the State Penn (Penn State) in ‘91 but he wanted me to take it to SC because he wanted to give it a real overhaul some day so off to SC it went with me. Fast forward to about ‘94 when the heater core sprung a leak. That was a PITA job even back then. I wanted to sell it but he wanted me to fix it so that his plan would still be alive. OK, being the nice father that I am I bought a heater core and dreaded the hours of work to put it in. That job traditionally required the removal of a lot of the under dash stuff like wiring harnesses, heater and A/C linkages and who knows what else. So, I start with taking out the glove box. When I did that I could see the plastic air duct that housed the heater core but to get the duct work out meant dismantling all of what I just mentioned. Then I got an idea. I help up the heater core against the plastic duct and it fit within the duct. So, I cut out a rectangular hole in the plastic and low and behold I could see old heater core. Only took the removal of a few mounting screws and the new one just about fell into place. Replaced the plastic duct after fabricating some pieces of sheet metal to hold it in place with pop rivets, applied some metal duck work tape (the aluminum sticky stuff), sprayed it with rattle can black and you had to look twice to see the duct had been modified. I had to save myself at least 5 hours of work and the best part was that I didn’t have to disturb anything under the dash. Therefore, I didn’t have to hold my breath when I would have had to see if a lot of the accessories would still work,

I’ve told you guys before, I’m ahead of the curve when it comes to stuff like this.

Oh yeah, in case anyone is wondering what happened to that valuable Omega, when we moved back to the Burgh in early ‘97, my son abandoned his dream of redoing that car so I sold it to the guy that packed the 2 U-Hauls when we left. If I had done that core replacement the traditional way I’d only have one son today.

Covid problem causing delay, my foot! That's what they've been told to say as an excuse. I told them I wasn't trying to get anything free from them.

Exactly. When something that never happens happens, your brain reacts sharply. I'd say it felt more like a truck crashing on my lawn rather than driving down the street. It was only 5km deep and the epicenter was just 7 miles or so from me. There was an initial boom that woke us, and the windows and bed shook for maybe 3-4 secs after. So, while earthquake crossed my mind, I thought there must have been an explosion given that initial boom.
I've lived through the Northridge quake (6.9), the Big Bear quake (7.1) and the Landers quake (7.3) when I was living in Palm Desert CA. Even though the Big Bear and Landers quakes were close (8-10 miles away from the epicenter), the Northridge quake (90 miles west of me) was the strongest that I ever felt. It literally tossed me out of bed at about 4:30 AM and the TV in my bedroom fell off my dresser and hit the ground. It felt like a locomotive hit my condo - unreal. Remember, when you get hit with a 6.9 to 7.3 quake, you get hundreds, if not thousands, of aftershocks for one to two years after the temblor. UGH!

Same thing is happening here, even on my street. Earlier this summer a nice but fairly typical 3 bed/1 bath/no garage/5000 sq ft lot/2-storey 1950s house up the street from me got into a bidding war before selling for well over asking at $386K. Not to be outdone, a similar house 4 doors up from that one but with a small attached garage just changed hands and the new owners are doing a full gut reno. I am guessing even the interior is being reconfigured as the chimney has been removed, along with the electrical and water service locations, the attached garage is gone, and this week a new roof is being installed. Still to come is some sort of new exterior siding. Where the garage used to be was excavated for a full foundation and then a 2-story addition with new garage built there. Presumably the upper level of the new construction is a master suite. I hate to think how much they will have in it by the time it's over. I have to think they paid at least $300K for the old untouched house. They must be playing the long game on this one.

Here's what it looked like before all the work:


Three years ago my condo was worth about $120,000. Today, it's worth $156,000 based on the sales of identical units in my condo community.

Looked at this tonight.

https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Williamstown_NJ/Butler-Dr

Nice home, but virtually no back yard. Wife loved the interior except for the bathroom floors. Mechanicals all at 15 years old and no finished basement pretty much made us move on.

https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/94-Quail-Ridge-Way_Mickleton_NJ_08056_M51246-04385?view=qv

We are going to try and look at this one in the next few days. Bit of a budget stretcher but doesn’t need much of anything. I don’t like the kitchen but wife said it’s workable.
I like the 2nd one. Kingsway is a pretty good school too. But if you would go to that price, could possibly go new but would be waiting into next year.

also, if the yard is too small, you will never be able to cure that problem. and a basement that size can cost an awful lot to finish.

price might push your tollerence, but getting brand new with no rehabs right away can save overall. Plus, with interest rates so low, $25,000 more is only like $100/month!

That would depend on the situation, if one car is rarely used it 's not that bad. We have three cars and one car is only taken out out rarely just to run it, which one depends on the season. A tandem garage would work well for us.

Amazon has a delayed order again for me. It was to come today by 9 pm when I ordered it on Monday. It went to a Portland OR Amazon facility at 8 pm local on Monday. Didn't leave there until 12:58 am local Portland time WEdnesday.

Arrived in Erlanger KY facility (Covington airport Cincinnati) at 9:07 am today Wednesday.

No way it gets from there to Dayton area today. Usually something hits the Erlanger Amazon facility and leaves there by 4 am and gets to Dayton area for the little gray/blue trucks to run it around.

Finally got a real person on CHAT at Amazon to gripe to. He said it was because of China Virus and they have so many new drivers. The drivers delivering aren't the problem: it's a warehouse time problem in Portland OR. He didn't seem to see what I saw in the times in the tracking.

Covid problem causing delay, my foot! That's what they've been told to say as an excuse. I told them I wasn't trying to get anything free from them. I told them I'd still order and still get 90%+ great delivery timing. I just wanted someone to notice what happened, holiday or not on Monday when item was ordered.

BTW, it was a 500GB 3.5 hard drive replacement for computer I'm repairing for friends. Hard to find size in new rather than refurbished in 3.5 in. for desktops.

The current hard drive works but SMART says it's defective because it has blocked out a huge number of sectors. I'm afraid to run CHKDSK on it to see what that finds since HDD is still running. They have to press F1 after a black screen for it to boot from cold stop because it warns of impending failure of the HDD.
My printer gave up the ghost last week and last Friday I ordered a new one from Best Buy and it was supposed to be delivered on Wednesday, it showed up on my door step Tuesday just before noon. I don't think it's the pandemic I think your assessment is right.

Three years ago my condo was worth about $120,000. Today, it's worth $156,000 based on the sales of identical units in my condo community. The reason has to do with the onslaught of Chicagoans, New Yorkers, Jerseyites and other northern areas migrating to Florida to get away from the high taxes and lawlessness. There are over 1000 people a day who move to Florida every day.

We have low sales taxes (6-7%) and no income taxes. The cost of food is lower and the cost of clothing is as well (no need for warm clothing).

Moving companies are overwhelmed by the numbers of requests to move belongings to Florida, Texas and Arizona.
No need for warm clothing? Last time I was in Mouseland, err I mean Orlando, in December I saw people with parkas on in 60 degree weather.

Roof isn't leaking, just old. Realtor thinks it will just sweeten the deal for the prospective buyer. She had a house listed in Pennsauken of all places that had 40 showings in two days and has been bid up well over asking. She had to cut off any future showings.

Probably so. However looking at that Arizona listing and the pictures of it, it seems the only neighbors popping by for visits would be coyotes and snakes, so the owner probably has lots of free time to attend to the vehicles. It looks rather, uh, remote.

The interiors of that Arizona house appear straight out of Architectural Digest but are so minimal in the photos that it had to be staged within an inch of its life. I have to think there were a few tractor-trailers worth of life stuff that was removed prior to the photo session that were parked just out of sight.

3% money will definitely skew the market. Shopped for a house with my son and his girl, this summer. Entry level price points, and it was brutal. What person takes an offer in the first two hours, when they have 12 more appointments to see the house, the first day?

Five years ago, I used to laugh my a-- off, watching the HGTV shows, with real estate people saying you should offer over asking. This summer, we did that three times.

I wonder if those two things are related?

It seems that serviceability is not a high priority for many auto manufacturers these days, and not just Ford. For years on many GM cars, replacing a heater core required removing the inner fender, which first meant removing everything that was attached to it and then removing the RF wheel. In some instances it also involved removing the passenger front seat and the glovebox. Now a heater core typically goes a great many years before needing replacing so perhaps that is excusable. But on my ATS, when a headlamp bulb blows and needs replacement a similar wheel/fender liner removal is necessary. I mean, come on. Couldn't they just engineer a little hatch or cover of some sort and let you avoid that?

Its really not that remote, only about a mile or so drive from a rather populated area that is pretty much a suburb of Phoenix, AZ (just under 30 miles as the crow flies). As for the interior, you might be right but it could also be a second home for some rich dude that's basically used to house his car collection and the rest of the house is just basic minimalist décor as it is not the main purpose of the house. There are houses nearby, but this house is where it's really thinning out but there are multiple homes within walking distance.

Exactly. When something that never happens happens, your brain reacts sharply. I'd say it felt more like a truck crashing on my lawn rather than driving down the street. It was only 5km deep and the epicenter was just 7 miles or so from me. There was an initial boom that woke us, and the windows and bed shook for maybe 3-4 secs after.

It's all about what you're used to. Growing up in SoCal, I experienced my fair share of earthquakes - Sylmar '71, the Loma Prieta quake in '89 (I was 300 miles away, and it was still strong there), a few others. By the time you realize what's happening, it usually over.

But, years ago, I was on a business trip to Milwaukee and one night there was a tornado warning pretty close to the hotel. I was terrified.

During one of my many trips to one of our suppliers in the LA area in the late ‘80, a 5.1 quake hit the area. A group of us were having lunch on the patio at this supplier when a guy runs up to us, almost out of breath, to ask if we were alright. When we asked why he said, “didn’t you feel the quake we just had”? None of us felt a thing. He goes on to tell us everyone in the building felt it and everyone was OK but a couple pieces of machinery on the production floor broke loose from the heavy duty bolts that held them to the floor and moved about 6 inches but other than that there was no damage. We all went in to see the machinery and sure enough, they had skated a few inches from their mounting bolts. Up until then I always thought you’d feel a pretty good shake with a 5.1 quake. Turns out I was wrong and was told by the guys, that have lived in southern Cal all their lives, that some quakes can be very localized even on the same block.

I was on the 11th floor of the only high rise in my town - the entire building swayed back and forth (as it was designed to do). When I got in my car to drive home and learned that the quake was up in the Bay Area, I knew then and there that it was a bad one.

I remember my dad taking us to see the VA hospital in LA after the '71 quake.

I'm thinking it's going to be Williamstown/Sewell or Mullica Hill. We keep looking in your area, but not quite finding what we want at the price point we want to be. We are looking to keep it around $425 or so.

Same thing is happening here, even on my street. Earlier this summer a nice but fairly typical 3 bed/1 bath/no garage/5000 sq ft lot/2-storey 1950s house up the street from me got into a bidding war before selling for well over asking at $386K. Not to be outdone, a similar house 4 doors up from that one but with a small attached garage just changed hands and the new owners are doing a full gut reno. I am guessing even the interior is being reconfigured as the chimney has been removed, along with the electrical and water service locations, the attached garage is gone, and this week a new roof is being installed. Still to come is some sort of new exterior siding. Where the garage used to be was excavated for a full foundation and then a 2-story addition with new garage built there. Presumably the upper level of the new construction is a master suite. I hate to think how much they will have in it by the time it's over. I have to think they paid at least $300K for the old untouched house. They must be playing the long game on this one.

Here's what it looked like before all the work:

Glad to hear it hasn't affected her health. There seem to have been a high percentage of false positives with certain tests. Unless she tests positive for the blood antibodies, I'd assume she had nothing.

I didn't have a second antibody test but I suspect I had the typically mild case a few weeks after I had the first self-prescribed antibody test. No big deal for me.

If they are following proper accounting practices then it would still be an expense to the sales department. Any funds pay out from petty cash needs the date of the expense, the reason for the expense and the cost center to be charged for so that when accounting replaces the petty cash funds they can charge the proper account.
I figured it would have to be accounted for by some dept. Not sure which one gets the “ding”. But, the Sales Manager I spoke with says it doesn’t come out of his pot. Maybe it’s just a matter of time before whatever dept is getting charged wises up and shifts it over to sales. Or, perhaps it’s just considered an operational expense.

I have two more today. Should be done by 1:00 p.m., at the latest. Then, grilling out with the GF and my son.

I think I’ll be pretty slow until the end of this month, being end of quarter.

Some other observations at the dealerships.....

-just eyeballing, I’d say there are about ½ the sales people that most of these dealerships have in normal times
-they are putting and emphasis on service business and offering new services (like detailing cars and charging extra for sanitizing them)
-For Acura at least, they have 2 retailers for sold cars, not the usual 4
-Sales people are finding and moving cars to get the ones customers want, vs having someone else do it
-dealerships appreciate me being prompt and efficient. Hope they like the service as I pride myself on being a business person and knowing how important service is. I’m transporting some of these cars in about ½ the time as their own staff.

Toyota is an interesting case study. The one I’m working with the most is probably one of the highest volume dealers in the state, if not the region. Observed a lady who was getting ready to leave because the dealership didn’t have the color of Camry she wanted (which was odd, because she wanted silver). I pulled up in a silver Camry dealer trade just as the sales person and lady was walking out the door of the dealership. Like clockwork, sales guy asks if the one I pulled up with belongs to the dealership...me..”no idea but I’m just transporting it to your store”. While I stopped to get a coffee from their coffee machine, I saw him slap a “hold” sign on it. Don’t know if he made the sale, but the lady came back into the dealership.

This is a real education for me.

Son #1 is a cyclist of sorts. Don’t know where he got that because it damn sure wasn’t from me. That is waaay to much work for me. He doesn’t go on public streets and roads. He goes on those bike paths and goes quite far at times. Goes with his wife and three sons, sleeps over a lot of times then gets up and goes again. Like I said waay too much work for me.

Last night grandson #1 came over for dinner and told us this:

He decided not to go with the family and his mother’s brother and GF from Ohio on a trip to DC. Maybe for the better. He said his father and youngest brother had their bikes stolen some where on a downtown DC street when everyone was at a restaurant having lunch. The bikes were chained to a bike rack in broad daylight but that didn’t stop the thieves. Fortunately only the two bikes were stolen. I guess it could have been more. Not to ruin the bike trip, he is renting two bikes to finish the tour. Yes, he filed a police report and mentioned to the police that he thought he had a good enough hardened steel lock and chain but it must not have been good enough. The police said that some of these thieves have pairs of car batteries connected to plasma cutters and nothing stops that. So, he’s out over 2 grand for those bikes (not sure if he has insurance for that). Maybe he plans to work overtime at the flip to make up for that loss but I ain’t.

Interesting stories and observations.
+1 I like hearing these stories too....from a working guy.
Same with oldfarmer's experiences.........they remind me of when I once worked. These days I have been very busy, getting the plumber to come and fix a plugged up kitchen sink, trying to find the problem with a faulty cable box (trying different ones to see if it is the TV or the cable box), trying to find a dent guy that will answer my email when they say in their ads they will email you back a quote, trying to get our lawn guy to cut down a diseased tree- finally did that, and playing tennis for 2 hours a day 6 days a week.................so I need these real stories of people actually doing stuff.

You’re in good company. There are dozens of TV shows which follow people just doing regular stuff like cleaning drains or fixing up and selling a house. My wife likes to watch various living in the wilderness shows where people fight with the weather as the heat goes out or the generator breaks down and drama is created as they try to fix it.

Then there’s Mike Rowe’s ‘Dirty Jobs’ which chronicles people doing what nobody else wants to do.

Starting in March when all live sports got paused and there wasn't that to watch on TV any more - which I came to realize made up most of my TV watching these days - I was looking for something to fill the time and gravitated to some of those shows. Most are pretty awful and I find many of the lead players quite off-putting. I really do not understand what makes them so popular in a lot of cases *cough*FixerUpper*cough*.

One of the ones I was able to tolerate was ""Building Alaska"" which, if you can get past the premise of some of their projects - ""person who has never built anything decides to build a place on a piece of property on top of a 100-foot cliff 100 miles from civilization completely off the grid and only accessible by boat"" - can be somewhat interesting. But I quickly discovered that not only is a lot of the stuff scripted or at least staged to reflect things that might have actually happened off-camera, but that also each hour-long* (*42 minutes with commercials) episode probably has maybe 20 minutes of actual footage. The rest is scenery, teasers, set-ups, and then recaps after coming back from commercial of something that in the end amounted to nothing at all. One example I recall is a piece that showed them running wiring and installing an electrical panel in a new place with the intent of running things off a portable generator until their solar/battery system got installed. The guy has a helper plug the panel into a generator and then makes a bit of a show about how all he needs to do is flip this breaker to have lights inside. Then they cut away to an exterior shot as you hear him say ""Oh no!"". I swear they used that last 5-second clip 4 or 5 times throughout the show. As it happened he supposedly flipped the wrong breaker and then seconds later hit the correct one to make the lights come on. Such drama!

Yep, just a lot of drama but those shows are popular. If they want real world they should come over to the flip house a couple times. I have to admit we don't have surprises per se but what you would see is real. Sometimes even the nail gun acts up.

All day today we were racing to catch up with demand at the airport. Quite a few times I pulled into the garage and the agent was loading in a customer as I was getting out. Kind of make you feel important doesn’t it.
OF....having fun, for sure. I don’t stick around long enough at the dealerships to get into any protracted conversations other than what I eaves drop on. While there’s really no down side, I am only transporting mostly mundane vehicles. A couple of exceptions....the Toyota Avalon TRD, RDX (which is probably what I’d buy if I were ever in the CUV/SUV market) and ILX A-Spec. But, mostly it’s more mundane transports.

There’s a Porsche dealership (only one in Cincinnati) that I’m going to drop in to see later this afternoon to see what it would take to get their transport business. Surprisingly, I haven’t had much push back on meeting with dealership management. I always frame it as “I’ll help you sell more cars by getting what your customers want”. They like that approach and see the value.

That said, I pretty much reached my limit on transports I can personally do. That became apparent this weekend. And, so as not to disappoint or turn down a dealership, I’ve got a friend (Ford Engineer-retiree) who will help me when needed.

Toyota sales manager wanted to know if I wanted a job in sales after gushing about the Avalon TRD. I politely declined stating I wouldn’t work the hours they wanted me to work. Let me do it part time? May be interested. He didn’t say “no”. He didn’t say “yes”, either.

25%? That's not a tough call. That's an easy call. If your worth that much, then you under-negotiated your current salary.
Not necessarily. I did negotiate and they changed the role to a Sr position once the CEO approved me to be at the top of the pay scale. New job is more responsibility for a much larger company.

In case anyone is wondering, I spoke to them again on Friday and their offer came in stronger than the original conversation making it an effective 30% increase, WFH/30 % travel, and 3 weeks vacation right out of the gate. A no brainer and I will be accepting and giving notice today providing there are no surprises in the formal written letter.

1804,Sep-08,28firefighter,"Is anyone here particularly good with home networking?

I recently upgraded our Fiber connection to a gigabit connection, because it was only $10/month more. However after doing so, I realized just how poor my home wifi setup is. We do have whole home hardwired connections that all terminate in an OnQ box up in our laundry room. That box is also where our Fiber connection comes into.

In that box I have a Netgear Nighthawk AX6 that I picked up recently at Costco. Performance when connected to that router is very good - nearly 900mbps down and 900 up. However coverage of the house from that location is very poor. I have two Apple Airport Extreme APs setup in bridge mode to extend the wireless network. Performance on those is less stellar - 500 up and down if you are connected to 5 ghz and close by. Two issues:
(1) Performance drops off quickly by an order of magnitude

(2) The hand-off of devices between all 3 APs is really poor - meaning devices cling to the last AP they were connected to until some random point, even if they've moved to a room with a new AP.

I've looked into the Mesh systems, but while they provide consistent performance, they don't seem to provide fast AND consistent performance.

Any recommendations short of looking into enterprise equipment?

I really like that line. Business managers are busy and don't want to waste time....so a quick snappy line that can get their attention and is the best way to get your foot in the door. Another key point is you are telling them about a way for them to make more money....all in one simple line that has to grab their attention.

One thing I would recommend and this came up in a sales talk about ways to make ""hard selling"" softer, is to send them a very brief attention getting brochure/letter before calling, and say you will be contacting them in a day or two. If the Porsche guy is hard to see....it is worth a try, should be brief, get their attention, somehow say this will save you time and money and actually make you more money.....everyone loves to hear that. Any business guy that knows what he is doing should be open to any idea that could be a winner for him.

That’s great. It’s humbling to be among the captain’s of industry with you and graphicguy.

Speaking of “guys”, I had mine show up to do some repairs caused by a storm in March. Everything shut down right about then so I had to wait until later only to find repair services were swamped. I had to contract with a second guy who ran a smaller operation. He fixed all the storm damage, including some I hadn’t noticed. Then he started on some exterior trim work and a new front door (which I had been putting off doing myself). He’ll finish tomorrow and for $500 less than the bigger company had estimated.

Sounds like my experience in 2017 when I got the ATS. The trial ended after 3 or 4 weeks. I called and they said the car was purchased in June so tough luck. Problem was it was purchased at the beginning of September. The only way they would restart it is if I gave them a credit card to put on file. Not a chance. They pretty much accused me of trying to scam them. An ironic comment considering the source. I had to get the dealership involved to get it restarted. Just one of the many reasons I have zero use for Sirius/XM.

I get solicitations for my son's Cruze because I owned it at first and he hated the idea of the music on XM. So he didn't want any of the free offers they kept making.

Myself I enjoyed when I got the long, long trial on my Malibu. Apparently however the dealer set it up for XM upon purchase never got done the right way for a trial. I know the saleslady said they had trouble setting up the SiriusXM trial. I waited for the trail to expire and then I was going to pick up the offer that some here were describing SiriusXM offering after they let their subscriptions expire and SiriusXM was desperate to get them back. I suspect Malibu still showed as a dealer car waiting for sale or something like that, so the trial just kept going and going like the Energizer bunny.

Some of you guys could write my marketing “cut sheet” I hand out to dealerships.

I’m an on demand service. I’m not carried on payroll. They don’t pay me for dead time. I carry my own liability insurance. The big one.....they can pay me out of petty cash, and not cut a check. A check would be an expense to the sales dept. I can slip in under whatever rules they have for petty cash (usually $250-$500). I collect after each delivery, so it’s not a rolling amount that would exceed their petty cash restrictions.

I’m kind of lucky as I’m within 10 to 15 minutes of a whole slew of new car dealerships (Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, Cadillac, VW, Honda, Toyota, Chevrolet, Mazda, BMW, Merceds, Kia, Volvo, Acura, GMC, Ford, Buick).

$25 minimum per car if delivered under 10 miles. Over 10 miles, it’s $25 plus $1/mile. Over 25 miles (one way) I will quote separately. One way transport is mileage plus the expense of me UBERING home. They’d rather get something for their money, so the do dealer trades to get the most bang for their buck.

I know what you’re thinking....”GG, that’s probably $50/hour”. True. But, transporting between 2 dealerships, each dealership bears ½ the cost. Again, no $10/hr lot boy who can (and probably has) backed into one of the new pristine cars on your lot. No liability. And, I’m not lolly gagging around. I deliver the car, collect my money from the cashier I give them a slip stating what I delivered, where it was delivered from, and who authorized me to do the transport. They only have to put a slip in the cash box to pay me.

By the time I’m done today, I’ll have made around $700+ in the last 3 days. And, I already have another retiree who’s willing to help so if I can snag a few more dealerships, I’ll have a nice little business running. Again, won’t get rich from it, but keeps me busy and I’m enjoying it.

Picking up bits and pieces of the sales guys’ pitch. No wonder there’s so much turnover. I’m sure there are a lot of newbies, but geez-Louise....are you training these guys to be a PITA to sell cars?

RB...answering your question....Corollas aren’t my cup of tea. They are innocuous to drive, which is probably the point. Given Toyota’s reputation for quality, I’m a bit taken aback at the cheapness of the interiors. But, I would imagine if you want a car that gets good MPG, costs little to maintain, and will last 10+ years, you could do a lot worse than a Corolla.

Gotta go. Just got the word on the transport.

- a blank memory for a movie title or actor, an actress,
- a waste of time searching where we left our glasses or keys.
After 60 years most people have such a difficulty, which indicates that it is not a disease but rather a characteristic due to the passage of years.
Many people are concerned about these oversights hence the importance of the following statement:

Reminds me of when my mom was busy/flustered, and she'd yell out for you, first calling the name of dad/brother/uncle/dog/etc. When she got the name right on the first try, then watch out.

The dementia linked to physical mishaps makes me think of my grandpa - he had a couple of bad spills, and it seems he went downhill fast after that. He always liked to put on a goofy act (he could do a great Jerry Lewis impression), so it could be hard to tell. I remember calling to ask my grandmother something, close to Christmas. He answered the phone, and told me she was fishing. I am pretty sure she wasn't fishing in December, rather, she went to the store, but fishing was a big thing for him. He also asked me about my ""Chrysler"", which I've never owned - but he had a couple of Chryslers he liked. At that time I knew something was up, and it wasn't good. He passed on within a year, and the last few weeks were really tough, but at least it wasn't as drawn out as some.

On that note, my grandma is still alive and kicking at 93, but recently broke her leg by somehow getting tangled up with a door in her house, not sure how it happened. She's still really sharp - I visited her last week, and she's slowing down a lot, but still all there - she gets a kick out of watching vintage TV shows now, and watches them for hours a day. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come. Her one wish in life is to live out her days in her own house, and we'll do all possible to allow it.

Here in tech money/rich transplant/sketchy EB-5 land, I see late model Ferraris, Lambos etc every day, not to mention every variety of upper range German mass market lux cars. Someone buying a C or 3er etc to pose will be disappointed. Buy it because you like it, because nobody else cares. I am sure that's why jmonroe bought his Genny (because he liked it - posing in a Genny or an A6 or a GS or an E or a 5er etc is silly, but they are still nice to drive).

There are parts of CA like the central valley where an Audi can seem special still. After-all, along the I99 you have to go from Bakersfield to Fresno to find another Audi dealership. That's a wide area of many miles. I might hesitate to buy a brand if the closest dealership was 2 hours away.

The snobbery thing amuses me. All of the mass market premium cars are attainable for anyone with decent credit and a little cash flow - most lease easily. They are so common anymore, especially in relatively affluent areas, that anyone buying one to appear special might be disappointed when everyone ignores it. I think one needs to spend 6 figures to get real snob appeal anymore (or buy a cool vintage model for a fraction of the price but with 50x the style).

yes but I got a new engine at no cost as it was replaced under warranty. Not to mention before it did go gave us almost 100k flawless miles.
If the warranty is 100K then it's rather almost impossible to have anything other than ""up to 100K flawless"" miles as if the miles came flawed you'd take it in for warranty service.

Still, I think your implication is the engine worked fine with no signs of impeding doom until it was gone in a flash.

Like several have said, it isn’t about money at that point. And the relationship with your leaders will never be the same at the original job if you take it - they’ll know your “loyalty” can be bought.

Time for what would you do?

So I took a new job about 5 weeks ago. Good company, but truth be told the CEO didn’t quite explain the day to day. I’m not entirely happy, and really feel like I’m not doing what I was hired to do either. On the flip side the money is good, WFH, and there should be room for advancement.

Today I get a phone call from the retailer that I had an offer pending with before Covid hit. He explained that they want to now offer me a Sr level position with 4 direct reports one of them being a PM I had at my last job. Salary is just shy of a 25% bump.

I feel bad because they just made a big announcement on LinkedIn and during a Town Hall. OTOH I feel it’s a much better opportunity and basically a carbon copy of what I did at the other retailer. It’s a tough call.

Thanks for listening.
25%? That's not a tough call. That's an easy call. If your worth that much, then you under-negotiated your current salary.

Or just flat out tell them you don't listen to the radio, or even easier, you don't have the car any more (technically true!) and they will take you off the list.

you can also (in your Email account) flag their Email addresses as Spam, and have them go straight to the spam folder, never to be seen from again.
Stop making so much sense, will you? How’s an old man supposed to rant?

Actually there is a number I can call on Monday but I’m already over it. It’s just that it was included in a bunch of other spam emails that are the result of my company sending out a group email months ago that exposed the emails of everyone on the list.

I don’t know much about email blasts but someone out of the hundred or so people whose email addresses were exposed allowed the list into the hands of spam marketers. Ever since I’ve been getting dozens of spam email. I block them as they come in only to get more from a slightly altered address.

He is back in CA now, and is preparing to enter the national Fire Academy in San Diego. He is insistent on living a life of service, and since my dad was a firefighter, he is honoring his memory as well.

Warning....lengthy post.......

Whew...feels good to be really busy. I’m actually sitting in Starbucks right now waiting for a call from Toyota to do another transport. I can practically see their dealership from where I’m sitting.

Some of you guys could write my marketing “cut sheet” I hand out to dealerships.

I’m an on demand service. I’m not carried on payroll. They don’t pay me for dead time. I carry my own liability insurance. The big one.....they can pay me out of petty cash, and not cut a check. A check would be an expense to the sales dept. I can slip in under whatever rules they have for petty cash (usually $250-$500). I collect after each delivery, so it’s not a rolling amount that would exceed their petty cash restrictions.

I’m kind of lucky as I’m within 10 to 15 minutes of a whole slew of new car dealerships (Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, Cadillac, VW, Honda, Toyota, Chevrolet, Mazda, BMW, Merceds, Kia, Volvo, Acura, GMC, Ford, Buick).

$25 minimum per car if delivered under 10 miles. Over 10 miles, it’s $25 plus $1/mile. Over 25 miles (one way) I will quote separately. One way transport is mileage plus the expense of me UBERING home. They’d rather get something for their money, so the do dealer trades to get the most bang for their buck.

I know what you’re thinking....”GG, that’s probably $50/hour”. True. But, transporting between 2 dealerships, each dealership bears ½ the cost. Again, no $10/hr lot boy who can (and probably has) backed into one of the new pristine cars on your lot. No liability. And, I’m not lolly gagging around. I deliver the car, collect my money from the cashier I give them a slip stating what I delivered, where it was delivered from, and who authorized me to do the transport. They only have to put a slip in the cash box to pay me.

By the time I’m done today, I’ll have made around $700+ in the last 3 days. And, I already have another retiree who’s willing to help so if I can snag a few more dealerships, I’ll have a nice little business running. Again, won’t get rich from it, but keeps me busy and I’m enjoying it.

Picking up bits and pieces of the sales guys’ pitch. No wonder there’s so much turnover. I’m sure there are a lot of newbies, but geez-Louise....are you training these guys to be a PITA to sell cars?

RB...answering your question....Corollas aren’t my cup of tea. They are innocuous to drive, which is probably the point. Given Toyota’s reputation for quality, I’m a bit taken aback at the cheapness of the interiors. But, I would imagine if you want a car that gets good MPG, costs little to maintain, and will last 10+ years, you could do a lot worse than a Corolla.

Gotta go. Just got the word on the transport.
Don’t work too hard now, remember, you’re retired.🥳

There are still a few original owners on her street, in a little development where places cost 15-18K or so new, and now when one hits the market at ~500K it'll be pending in 12 hours.

OK, here’s something I tried today. I’ve been watching videos on rust prevention and was intrigued by the possibility of getting protection by spraying oil into the door bottoms and rockers. The theory is that by coating areas where water and salt might accumulate you can retard the rusting process.

So this morning I stuck the wand on a can of WD-40 into the drain holes of all the doors on my Kia and sprayed until I saw it dripping out. I then pried the sill covers off and shot some more into the rocker voids. Interestingly, I hadn't been able to see any drains for the rockers but sure enough the oil found it’s way out.

I figure I’ll repeat the process once a year before winter.

So what do you think? Good, bad, waste of time? You have to realize I’ve never junked a vehicle because it broke mechanically. They all died of road cancer.
An old and time-honored practice. Up here the service stations used to promote oil spraying - using waste motor oil they collected - which was similar to what you did, except they put the car on the hoist and sprayed the undercarriage too. Later that morphed to them offering ""grease and graphite"" treatments, applied in the same manner. I believe that was an actual product they bought rather than recycled motor oil.

In the late '70s/early '80s engineered products sprayed into cavities and crevices that were thin enough to creep into hidden seams, etc became very popular here - Rust Check was first, then Krown which was slightly less runny. They do work well if you are diligent in doing them annually. I see an '80s Regal here regularly that has maybe 20 annual Rust Check stickers on the windows and it still looks almost new. Up here you can buy aerosol cans of Rust Check and other rust preventative compounds like Fluid Film to do what you started doing.

Every year, he crawls under it and brushes it down good, then sprays some sort of rustoleum/undercoating stuff (rattle cans I think) on the frame, in an attempt to keep it from rotting out and snapping in half, like they tend to do. So far, seems to be working!

Back in the 80’s I worked with a guy who poured and sprayed good ole engine oil in his doors and rocker panels just before the salt season began and he swore up and down it worked. I have to admit for as old as his cars were, they had no rust in those areas. He said he knew he got enough in there since he had drips on the paper he had on his garage floor for days.

FWIW, his name was Ron but after divulging what he did he became affectionately known as Rusty Ron and to his closest friends just Rusty which caught on pretty quickly.

So yeah, I’d say it works.

WD-40 won't do anything to prevent rust; you need a product that is formulated to prevent rust. You want something that is waxy and adheres to the surface- like this or this.

I always thought the Corolla interiors were the cheapest looking around, even cheaper than Nissan’s. Good for the purpose they are made for. If you want performance in a little car get a Honda Civic R.

I agree, dealers are selling cars. We are emptying out our offices all over the Northeast. We’re not delivering a lot to dealers so maybe they’re just sending them to auction. Must be like Varoom, making a killing while they can. I know our local holding lots are still empty.

I wondered the same thing as most dealers around here hire retirees to do swaps instead of outside contractors. I imagine that they save on government mandated expenses like worker’s comp, disability and 6.2% social security tax. Also GG must hold his own business insurance so if he rolls an Impala doing 110 the dealer is off the hook.

Hiring kids as you mentioned is not always a good idea. Many years ago a youngster transporting for a dealer rolled a new car on my lawn when he took the corner too fast. Took out a row of 10’ Arborvitae trees.

1904,Sep-05,abacomike,"Went up to Boca Raton to visit one of my dear friends - stopped off at Einstein's Bagels and picked up bagels, cream cheese, nova lox, capers, tomatoes and onions for lunch. It was quite tasty.

This is the guy who passed out in the shower in October of last year and ended up breaking his neck - had two surgeries to fix the broken vertebrae. About 10 weeks ago, he again lost consciousness in his garage and ended up breaking his wrist. Spent 2 weeks in the hospital and 8 weeks in rehab learning how to walk again. He now has no control of urination and must wear a diaper.

He is only 70 years old and is, in my opinion, suffering from onset of dementia or Alzheimer's. I remember when my Dad started to have problems with his memory before the onset of Alzheimer's.

One year ago this guy was walking with me and my other friend at the mall 2-3 miles a day. Now he can barely make it from his living room to the kitchen with a walker.

About 10 years younger - very active - and yes, since she is in control, a complete assessment and evaluation should have been done months ago. I believe there is some sort of pre-nup.

Went up to Boca Raton to visit one of my dear friends - stopped off at Einstein's Bagels and picked up bagels, cream cheese, nova lox, capers, tomatoes and onions for lunch. It was quite tasty.

This is the guy who passed out in the shower in October of last year and ended up breaking his neck - had two surgeries to fix the broken vertebrae. About 10 weeks ago, he again lost consciousness in his garage and ended up breaking his wrist. Spent 2 weeks in the hospital and 8 weeks in rehab learning how to walk again. He now has no control of urination and must wear a diaper.

He is only 70 years old and is, in my opinion, suffering from onset of dementia or Alzheimer's. I remember when my Dad started to have problems with his memory before the onset of Alzheimer's.

One year ago this guy was walking with me and my other friend at the mall 2-3 miles a day. Now he can barely make it from his living room to the kitchen with a walker.

So I took a new job about 5 weeks ago. Good company, but truth be told the CEO didn’t quite explain the day to day. I’m not entirely happy, and really feel like I’m not doing what I was hired to do either. On the flip side the money is good, WFH, and there should be room for advancement.

Today I get a phone call from the retailer that I had an offer pending with before Covid hit. He explained that they want to now offer me a Sr level position with 4 direct reports one of them being a PM I had at my last job. Salary is just shy of a 25% bump.

I feel bad because they just made a big announcement on LinkedIn and during a Town Hall. OTOH I feel it’s a much better opportunity and basically a carbon copy of what I did at the other retailer. It’s a tough call.

Thanks for listening.
@tjc78, Not to scare you but don't look a gift horse in the mouth. While it is flattering to get a new job offer at a 25% wage premium I would not be too quick to jump ship after just five weeks in your current job. In these uncertain economic times, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 1,000 points today, I would exercise caution and stay put for a while. The retail industry can be very fickle. And even the Walmart's and Target's of this world are not immune to economic factors.

In my experience I remember my former company being very pisssed off at a new HR director who quit after only one week on the job to go back to her original job. As karma would have it she was fired from her original company...making permanent enemies on both sides. What a tragedy. Good luck in whatever decision you make."

I took the 2013 Audi A4 to a collision garage after a grandson put a dent in the bumper. It was a small job and they fixed it for $125. I got there early and I saw a guy in a little car drive in that had dent repairs done...painted on the door. So, I figure, the job was too small for them to do, but they probably pay him $50 or $75, then collect $125 from me....so I am thinking of going direct.

As usual I was mediocre at the autocross, but the M2C is just way too much fun.


The drag race was interesting. You also had to stop at the end within a “stop box” to win. The cars were Competition versions of the X5 M, X6 M, M8, and M2. I won two drag races and my son won another.


Lapping the tri-oval was a lead-follow exercise. All the cars were M8C coupes, Gran Coupes, and convertibles.


We were lucky to see 115 mph; we had a real slow poke in our group. I did get a couple of laps behind the instructor but we left the timid folks behind and had to slow down so that they could catch up. My son didn’t have any better luck.

Peen may refer to: Part of the head of a hammer, as in a ball-peen hammer (also ball-pein ,or ball and pein) Peening, the working of metal by hammering. Peening (scythe blade), peening a scythe or sickle blade as a step in sharpening it.

That’s the problem with taking your car in for service. While they may fix problem A, they can screw up B and C. Check your lug nuts before leaving their lot if there is any chance they had to work around your wheels.

Getting a 6.6 Olds 403 in a Trans Am instead of the real 6.6 Pontiac 400 engine which everybody wanted both then and now. And the general criticism from car buyers of that era: ""Pay more and get less.""

I've heard many anecdotes about cars assembled with different trim on the right/left sides yet that kind of thing happened back in the 50s too. But how could any car from another era match the Ford Granada with an example of Job #1 Quality like this:

THAT is not a Mustang!

As to my current ride, it hasn’t hit 14k miles yet so still feels new. Today I just ordered a new set of tires for it because the OEM are past the 5 year replacement deadline. Plenty of tread left but getting too old.

There’s really nothing on a new (real) Mustang that makes it a must have. I suppose I could get one with the magnetic shocks or the performance pack but that would drive the cost beyond my limits. As to power, mine puts out as much as a 2020 (460hp) thanks to some modest mods. The only way to go beyond that is to spend a ton more money on something like a GT 350.

Bottom line is I don’t drive it often enough to replace it. That’s the curse of trying to spread 12k miles of driving among 4 vehicles.
Yeh, no need to replace, and 460 h.p. is nice to have....for safety purposes only - like getting onto a highway.
They usually say tires are good for 6 years, and I have a feeling that might be a year or two on the extra safe side.....suggested by the tire makers.

Me, even though I would be nervous about doing it (too much confrontation!) I would make the move. If you are comfortable with the place (and you obviously wanted to be there previously) that part should be good. And the pay is hard to ignore. if what you are doing it not what you expected that is certainly a good justification. Does not look great jumping so soon, but it happens.

and remember, companies have zero loyalty. They could blow all kind of smoke your way, and as soon as something slips they will cut you loose before you know it is coming.

so if the other job is effectively a promotion and raise, and you are comfortable with the people and responsibilities (and of course in retail, that they will be around for a while!) it seems like a pretty obvious choice, but you are probably good either way.

Can you talk to your current employer to see if you can’t get the job tailored more to your liking? Maybe they’ll accommodate you. If not I don’t see you own them much loyalty after 5 weeks. Sometimes things don’t work out.

Well, if your definition of that is what it's like in Canada then it is only a partial benefit. Employers here still offer health benefit packages to cover what the govt plan fails to do - things like drug plans, dental and vision benefits, upgrades to hospitalization and a host of other things. Catastrophic coverage is really the main govt benefit.

I won’t stay even for a match in pay. Other than the short time of employment I don’t see a downside here. As I started my day at 6:30 something just doesn’t feel right and you have to be happy with what you are doing.

Agree. I have done that before, only to constantly wonder why the employer undervalued me to begin with. As I look back on my career, I never got enough of a salary bump from my old to match the jobs to warrant me not moving to another company.

I am happy with the Florida MB and it might not get any miles on it this year.....it has 34000 miles on it. My only reason for thinking of trading it was I saw a 2017 with more equipment...including rear camera and blind spot mirrors for $25000. I thought if I would get $14 or $15k for the 2014 it would be worth it to get a 3 year newer car, with 12000 miles on it. But, at $15000 difference it doesn't make sense to me.....and I could sell it privately but not that important to me to go through that.....hard to juggle the selling and the buying as well - can't be without a car there.....trade-in is my only real option.

IIRC STABIL states that it will keep gas good for 2 years, but I think that is pushing it. If I were you if you go back in a year I would drive that baby all over the place to get rid of that old gas and put in some nice fresh dino squeezins.

Oil typically has a 4 to 5 year shelf life and may vary from that depending on differing variables so two years isn't to long. But the question remains how long was it between the oil being made and getting in your car. You should be OK on the oil but I would change it quickly if it sits for two years.

2056,Sep-02,graphicguy,"Across the street and about 200 yards south of my Acura dealer are two dealerships not affiliated with the Acura dealer....a Toyota and Honda store, both part of the same dealer group. Got a call from a sales manager at the Toyota store around 4:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon telling me he got my name from one of the Acura sales people he hangs with for beers after work. He wanted to know if I was working exclusively for the 2 Acura stores (one in Dayton, one in Cincinnati). Told him I was not.

He asked if I could do a Toyota swap between his dealership, and one north of the city in 90 minutes. On a good day, not in rush hour traffic, probably a good bet I could. But, there's always a bottle neck on I 71 and the dealership I'd be transporting to is in a very busy area with a large auto mall. Add in rush hour, and it would be a challenge. I couldn't guarantee him I could. But, I sure would like to do transports for both Toyota and Honda stores.

I told him if I couldn't do it, there would be no charge for the transport. If I did do it, he had to give me a shot at his dealer trade transports.

Won't keep you in suspense. But, I made it with a few minutes to spare. Took a little bit of a round about way to get there and back to avoid traffic, but I did it. Swapped a 2021 Avalon Limited (didn't even know those were out yet) for a 2020 Avalon TRD.

I am happy with the Florida MB and it might not get any miles on it this year.....it has 34000 miles on it. My only reason for thinking of trading it was I saw a 2017 with more equipment...including rear camera and blind spot mirrors for $25000. I thought if I would get $14 or $15k for the 2014 it would be worth it to get a 3 year newer car, with 12000 miles on it. But, at $15000 difference it doesn't make sense to me.....and I could sell it privately but not that important to me to go through that.....hard to juggle the selling and the buying as well - can't be without a car there.....trade-in is my only real option.

How about you, ready to trade in the Mustang for a 2021 model?

THAT is not a Mustang!

As to my current ride, it hasn’t hit 14k miles yet so still feels new. Today I just ordered a new set of tires for it because the OEM are past the 5 year replacement deadline. Plenty of tread left but getting too old.

There’s really nothing on a new (real) Mustang that makes it a must have. I suppose I could get one with the magnetic shocks or the performance pack but that would drive the cost beyond my limits. As to power, mine puts out as much as a 2020 (460hp) thanks to some modest mods. The only way to go beyond that is to spend a ton more money on something like a GT 350.

Bottom line is I don’t drive it often enough to replace it. That’s the curse of trying to spread 12k miles of driving among 4 vehicles.

IIRC STABIL states that it will keep gas good for 2 years, but I think that is pushing it. If I were you if you go back in a year I would drive that baby all over the place to get rid of that old gas and put in some nice fresh dino squeezins.

Oil typically has a 4 to 5 year shelf life and may vary from that depending on differing variables so two years isn't to long. But the question remains how long was it between the oil being made and getting in your car. You should be OK on the oil but I would change it quickly if it sits for two years.
The STABIL was added last March, so should be good until next November when we will be able to go back hopefully - if not sooner. Oil gets changed yearly and was done last November, but has only gone 6000 miles. I think it can sit up to two years and probably longer without an oil change. The neighbors have the keys, so I suppose if it goes too long I could have one of those mechanics that come to the house change the oil. All kinds of things are possible...but, I am OK risking letting it sit for up to 2 years.

If you are not returning to Florida this winter then it might make sense to sell it now. Otherwise when you eventually do return it will have been laid up for 2 years. I don't know what kind of decommissioning you do but that might lead to some problems, and regardless it will be a 7 year-old car then.

Across the street and about 200 yards south of my Acura dealer are two dealerships not affiliated with the Acura dealer....a Toyota and Honda store, both part of the same dealer group. Got a call from a sales manager at the Toyota store around 4:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon telling me he got my name from one of the Acura sales people he hangs with for beers after work. He wanted to know if I was working exclusively for the 2 Acura stores (one in Dayton, one in Cincinnati). Told him I was not.

He asked if I could do a Toyota swap between his dealership, and one north of the city in 90 minutes. On a good day, not in rush hour traffic, probably a good bet I could. But, there's always a bottle neck on I 71 and the dealership I'd be transporting to is in a very busy area with a large auto mall. Add in rush hour, and it would be a challenge. I couldn't guarantee him I could. But, I sure would like to do transports for both Toyota and Honda stores.

I told him if I couldn't do it, there would be no charge for the transport. If I did do it, he had to give me a shot at his dealer trade transports.

Won't keep you in suspense. But, I made it with a few minutes to spare. Took a little bit of a round about way to get there and back to avoid traffic, but I did it. Swapped a 2021 Avalon Limited (didn't even know those were out yet) for a 2020 Avalon TRD.

So, looks like I'm expanding my little fledgling business.

On top of that the video quality rivals that of a good movie or TV production.

My best friend just bought a new Genesis G80 3.3 liter V6 Sport with Twin Turbo AWD in Siberian Ice (Silver) with Gray Nappa interior. Car is fully loaded with just about everything I have on my E450 4MATIC. He paid $53,000 +++. I drove it this morning and these are my impressions:

Car is really attractive and has a nice stance. Body fit is excellent and the wheels are quite nicely done. The interior is roomy except for the rear headroom - I felt my head against the roof when I sat back there. Audio system is above average and the screen is large. Quite powerful and handled beautifully around town. I took it onto the Turnpike and it held the lane with almost no need to adjust the steering wheel to keep it going in a straight line. The seats were comfortable and luxurious.

For a net cost of $10,000 less than my E450 cost me, not including tax, fees etc., it is well worth the money. If I was getting the G80, I would have leased it because resale value on the Genesis line is not very strong - but then again, neither is the Mercedes, BMW and Audi at the higher ends.

He wanted the AWD because that's what he has been driving for 12 years. He bought a 2008 Infiniti M35X back in 2008 and has 110,000 miles on it. It still runs perfectly with no issues, so he decided to give the Infiniti to his grandson because the trade value from several dealers was less than desirable. At least his grandson will enjoy the car for many more years the way my friend takes care of his cars.

All in all, I give it a thumbs up for anyone looking for a luxury, powerful AWD sedan that is priced well below any of its competitors.

Mostly, it is the guys in the terrible sounding JC Whitney exhaust systems, or even worse lighting schemes for the front and the rear. They’ve ranged from Cobalts to Civics...even a 6 cyl Mustang or two (pretty easy to tell those as they have GT badges glued all over them and sound anemic, to boot).

Depends on my mood, sometimes I engage, sometimes I lead them on a little bit letting them stay relatively even, until I get tired of the game and take off. Sometimes, I let them get way ahead of me, and then blow past them. Sometimes, I just leisurely go about my merry way without engaging them.

One thing’s for sure, those who only see the KIA badge and have no idea what it really is, are shocked at the end of the run (if they even pull even with me to see me gloat).
I can’t imagine a more fragile ego than someone who would glue GT badges on a V6 Mustang. And then to get smoked by a Kia must be the ultimate humiliation.

Not a lot. They replace the Pilot Sport A/S 3+, a tire I have been very pleased with on the Club Sport and M235i. I would have put them on the 2er if the had been available. My gut feeling is that they perform at least as well or better than summer high performance tires of 5-10 years ago.

The gap between a Kia/Hyundai/Genesis and the rest of the crowd isn’t what it was 20-25 years ago. They’ve caught up fast. And, I’d put it up against even the vaunted Honda or Toyota vehicles, which are known to have the best build quality in the business.

I had one of those nothing comes easy days. As many of you know the TL has been bragging the Check Engine Light. It was suggested that I replace the gas cap which I did with an OEM. After several weeks of limited driving and a couple of top ups of gas, no change. I filled the tank on Wednesday and drove it yesterday and the light went off. I had an appointment today to have it diagnosed and an oil change. As the TL went thru several cycles after the light extinguished the dealer said no code would be stored. So I had the oil changed and the car had a clean report needing no additional services. About 10 minutes on my drive home the CEL illuminates. I circle back to the dealer, they capture a code. A evap solenoid failure, part needs to be ordered. Not a big deal, but grrr.

It’s been very dry in my area all Summer long and my grass shows it. We have had quite a bit of rain the last two days and my grass is showing signs of perking up. My indy lawn service guy recommends airation and over seeding. That brought it around the last time we had a dry spell so I told him to sign me up. If I was really concerned about my grass I would have washed and waxed both cars a few times but I liked all the sun we’ve had lately.

I'm not far from you and, yes, it's been extremely dry.

In the spring I was mowing the outfield at the baseball field 3 times a week and could hardly keep up. A few times I actually had to get out the lawn sweeper.

For the last month and a half I have mowed about once every 2 weeks. It was brown and a little crunchy, but now it's greening up nicely after a few days of rain.

I always aerate, over seed, and fertilize in the fall with perennial rye grass. Not so much because of the weather, but because of all the little monsters running all over it with their metal cleats.

2138,Aug-30,roadburner,"Here's the sidebar from a story I wrote 15 years ago; that 645Ci had a V8 producing an astronomical 333 hp:

In my twenty-two years of BMW ownership I have owned several that have sported a somewhat-ahem-aggressive appearance. The major offenders included a Cinnabar Red 535is, a Sinister Black M6, and my current car, a Bright Red 318ti Club Sport. Every now and then it seems that the combination of color and various M Technic add-ons tend to awaken a competitive streak in certain other drivers. Well, let me tell you, nothing I’ve ever driven has brought the squirrels out of the trees like this Mystic Blue 645Ci droptop. Nothing.

I had my first encounter less than six hours after the car was delivered. My son and I were sitting at a light when a be-winged, be-skirted, and coffee-canned Eclipse pulled up. The driver began goosing his flatulent sounding motor-no doubt intending to impress his female passenger with the tri-colored hair and double-pierced nose. When the light changed I left on about 3/4 throttle-which was more than enough to leave him for dead-and I backed off at 45 mph(I did. REALLY!). The next day it was some hooligan in a Hemi powered half-ton Dodge Ram. Yes, a truck. He left the light with the rear tires squealing, but by the time he crossed the intersection I was already in the next county. Other unlucky contestants included a couple of late model Mustang GTs, a Z28, and what seemed to be the entire vehicular cast of The Fast and the Furious. It got so bad towards the end that my son looked over at one Mustang in the next lane and advised the driver, “Don’t even THINK about it.”

As a matter of fact, the only challenger who tasted victory was some doofus in a Jaguar XJ8. You see, my wife was in the car that time-so when my son announced, “Dad, that guy’s an idiot; you’re gonna SMOKE him!”-she replied, “Dad’s not going to race him, ARE YOU DAD?” “Of course not, dear”, I assured her.

One effect of this quarantine is that we are all set up with work from home offices (I am supposed to get an iPhone that my work phone will be forwarded to next week and that will complete it).

Sorry guys, I don’t buy it. Looks like more fluff made for the internet to me. Why? Because there are too many perfectly placed camera angles. On top of that the video quality rivals that of a good movie or TV production. Anytime I’ve seen security video’s the picture quality was very grainy and as a result, it would have been difficult to tell the color of the vehicles being towed let alone the model.

2169,Aug-31,abacomike,"My best friend just bought a new Genesis G80 3.3 liter V6 Sport with Twin Turbo AWD in Siberian Ice (Silver) with Gray Nappa interior. Car is fully loaded with just about everything I have on my E450 4MATIC. He paid $53,000 +++. I drove it this morning and these are my impressions:

Car is really attractive and has a nice stance. Body fit is excellent and the wheels are quite nicely done. The interior is roomy except for the rear headroom - I felt my head against the roof when I sat back there. Audio system is above average and the screen is large. Quite powerful and handled beautifully around town. I took it onto the Turnpike and it held the lane with almost no need to adjust the steering wheel to keep it going in a straight line. The seats were comfortable and luxurious.

For a net cost of $10,000 less than my E450 cost me, not including tax, fees etc., it is well worth the money. If I was getting the G80, I would have leased it because resale value on the Genesis line is not very strong - but then again, neither is the Mercedes, BMW and Audi at the higher ends.

He wanted the AWD because that's what he has been driving for 12 years. He bought a 2008 Infiniti M35X back in 2008 and has 110,000 miles on it. It still runs perfectly with no issues, so he decided to give the Infiniti to his grandson because the trade value from several dealers was less than desirable. At least his grandson will enjoy the car for many more years the way my friend takes care of his cars.

All in all, I give it a thumbs up for anyone looking for a luxury, powerful AWD sedan that is priced well below any of its competitors.

On Thursday night Cadillac had an online live event with the designer of the new CT5 sedan answering questions from those of us in cyberspace. I think the CT5 looks good except for the terrible workout of the rear door window/C-pillar area, which should never have been allowed to see the light of day.

I decided to take part and it seemed like they had less than 100 people out there joining me (maybe less than 50, it was hard to tell) so given the lack of questions I decided to ask one about that area on the car. He really didn't answer it well other than saying they were trying to pull down that part of the body to give it a hunkered-down look especially from the rear 3/4 perspective. He added that they dropped the beltline (I'm not sure what he meant by that since this is an all-new design so I don't know what he is comparing it to) for the same reason. That doesn't explain the plastic triangle filler piece nor the huge fixed pane in the rear door but whatever, I didn't really expect him to say that the bean counters wouldn't let them do something better.

In the case of the Camaro I think the same thing holds true in that they wanted to make it look low and hunkered down, but they went too far. The previous-gen Camaro had bad visibility for the same reason and on the refresh they made it worse. I don't know if the engineering of the car wouldn't let them drop the beltline to aid visibility or if it was a financial or aesthetic decision but GM really missed an opportunity with the refreshed design to make the car look different from the preceding one, Instead they made it look so much like the old one it takes a practiced eye to tell them apart.

You could just wash your car out on the lawn. Grass goes dormant during hot dry weather and a good watering will perk it up. A lot of lawn companies overseed with annual grass which comes up quick, makes a nice green carpet but dies over winter. The customer thinks the lawn guy is a miracle worker and since the perennial grass greens up in the fall anyway no one is the wiser. Try reseeding with fine fescue as it’s drought resistant and comes back year after year.

You could just wash your car out on the lawn. Grass goes dormant during hot dry weather and a good watering will perk it up. A lot of lawn companies overseed with annual grass which comes up quick, makes a nice green carpet but dies over winter. The customer thinks the lawn guy is a miracle worker and since the perennial grass greens up in the fall anyway no one is the wiser. Try reseeding with fine fescue as it’s drought resistant and comes back year after year.
I’ve used this lawn care guy for about 6 or 7 years and he’s a pretty straight shooter. Like I said he did this a few years ago when we had a dry spell. Not positive but I think that was in 2015. The yard perked up nicely after that service. He uses a mix of quick green stuff and even blue grass seed. Mrs. j commented that I killed a nice yard because I didn’t water it and she’s probably right but my guy will save me like he did before. But it’s going to cost me around 120 bucks to do it. Since I dispise yard work, that cost is fine with me. With being house bound and not going out to eat like we used to do in normal times, I’ve save a lot more than 120 bucks these past few months. The way I look at it that’s just a couple eating out meals.

2219,Aug-29,sda,"I had one of those nothing comes easy days. As many of you know the TL has been bragging the Check Engine Light. It was suggested that I replace the gas cap which I did with an OEM. After several weeks of limited driving and a couple of top ups of gas, no change. I filled the tank on Wednesday and drove it yesterday and the light went off. I had an appointment today to have it diagnosed and an oil change. As the TL went thru several cycles after the light extinguished the dealer said no code would be stored. So I had the oil changed and the car had a clean report needing no additional services. About 10 minutes on my drive home the CEL illuminates. I circle back to the dealer, they capture a code. A evap solenoid failure, part needs to be ordered. Not a big deal, but grrr.

Sorry to hear that but not surprised. If they replaced the windshield they would lose money on the sale of the car, and it might not fix the problem. I don't know how loud the noise is but it is a bit of a personal thing...some people are more sensitive to the sound than others. I guess the good news is your hearing is probably pretty good. The problem may go away as the rubber gets softer. Saying you won't buy another MB is pointless, they don't care....money given back is money out of their pocket, the future is a crap shoot. You might buy another one and might not, they don't care - they'll take the loss but somewhere there is an Audi buyer with a transmission that failed that will buy an MB next time....and on it goes............
Except when they lose so much market share that they are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, and have to whine and cry for the tax payers to bail them out for it in order for ANY of them to keep their jobs. Then they will care.

On the road the difference is considerable- the 2er hits 100 mph 17.4 seconds ahead of the Club Sport.
At the end of the day however, both cars are perfect for their intended use. The Club Sport shines on a twisting rural two lane; the steering is nearly telepathic and it has just enough power to make things interesting.
The M235i is a close coupled Junior GT; a couple of British magazines described it as a German take on a American ponycar- and that sounds about right.

I wouldn’t be so sure of that.
German government was essentially complicit with the dieselgate (unrealistic standards and laws requiring just passing the tests, i.e. not explicitly disallowing defeat devices) and allowed VW to show big middle finger to all its European customer to suck on as a compensation for their cheating, obvious reason being number of sold units was more than order of magnitude higher than here in the US, so any kind of compensation would basically put the company out of business, or at least significantly cripple it for long term. Owning the stock of VW plus knowing how German government is dependent on its heavy industry (very similar relationship as here between Washington and Wall Street), one knew they won't let any real harm to happen to them.

BTW, if Mike thinks his life is tough on the wiper chatter issue, there is a story of a Polish customer who bought (leased) top of the line S63 AMG with transmission vibrations and steering problems. There are multiple YouTube videos (they have English captions) with the saga, including recorded conversations with the service ""advisors"", correspondence with the importer company, etc. They flat out refuse to fix anything, claim everything is ""normal"" under tests, but also refuse to provide any kind of logs or records of those alleged ""tests"". There are different laws in Poland making Benz much more privileged in relation with customers vs. here, e.g. they guy can't even sue because he's formally not an owner, the lease company (MB Bank) is the owner and they refuse to recognize that MB gave them a defective product (but they are happy to collect payments from the customer of course). Complaints to the HQ in Germany brought absolutely no response, either. It's a story for the ages, one of those that makes you realized that ambulance chaser lawyers do have some useful purpose in society besides being a good ballast for a ship's anchor .

Smaller than I prefer. Needs a bit more HP and a lot more low end torque. Tossable...light on its feet (which I felt when I got back in my Stinger, which isn’t a slouch in the handling dept). Stereo wasn’t to my liking, but the TLX’s had the best car stereo I’ve ever heard. And, the Stinger’s stereo is still quite good.

It is noisy, but compared to what? Compared to my Stinger or my former TLX, yeah...it makes a lot of racket for not a lot of power. I sort of expected the choppy ride. But, most of the trip was on the interstate, both up and back. It was fine....cruised nicely...comfortable on the highway. I think a little more wheelbase would help, but that would make it even slower with the same drivetrain.

DENNIS O’SULLIVAN Answers to your car questions
Dennis, I have a 2018 Ford Edge Titanium 2.0 L Eco boost with approximately 42,000 kilometres on it. I had an oil change plus a general overall inspection done at the dealer recently and when I picked the vehicle up, there were several services that the dealer recommended that I should do. One of the suggestions, which surprised me, was a transmission service. When I asked why it would need the transmission fluid changed at 42,000 kilometres, I was told that Ford considers this area to be one with extreme driving conditions, with the cold winters and hot summers. According to the owner’s manual, the recommended interval for changing the fluid is 240,000 kilometres. The only conditions noted for changing the fluid at 48,000 kilometres are towing a trailer; extensive idling; low speed driving (delivery, taxi etc.) or in dusty or sandy conditions, none of which apply to me. Even with the current pandemic, probably 70% of my driving is highway. I have been driving for over fifty years and have had many vehicles and never had a dealer recommend changing the transmission fluid at 48,000 kilometres. I do not plan on having the fluid changed at this time but would appreciate knowing your thoughts on when it should be done. Thank you

Garry from Dundas

I thought Dennis's answer would be, ""Who ever heard of spelling Garry with 2 Rs"", but most of the answer is in the next post. I think the dealership is probably a little slow these days, so trying to add to their profit.

Ford of Canada is all over the map as to when the transmission fluid should be changed, anywhere from 60,000 kilometres to 150,000 kilometres. If not based on mileage, then it is recommended that the fluid be changed every two to four years and that in itself, will depend on the type of driving one does. The transmission oils used in today’s vehicles have so many additives and most transmissions have many solenoids and electrical connections that are susceptible to any type of contamination in the oil. It is wise to let your dealer make the determination as to when the transmission oil should be changed. That being said, it is also very wise for any Ford owner to make sure that the dealer is totally upfront with you as to why they are making the determination that the transmission fluid should be changed and the reasons given. “Ford considers this area to be one with extreme driving conditions with the cold winters and hot summers” is not a reason that I am aware of.

We had the daughter's MINI in for service a couple of weeks ago. They start off by texting a video inspection - brakes, tires, a quick peek at the undercarriage. All very nice, and, in the case of her car, everything had plenty of life left on it.

You will recall I got a letter from Kia concerning oil change intervals. They suggested that “most or all” driving in my area should be considered “severe” and that motor oil should be changed at 3750 miles rather than 7500. Despite calls and emails I never got an answer as to whether this advice included synthetic oils as well. One guy said the intervals were for both conventional and synthetic which told me he was clueless.

I suspect that many of these manufacturers are trying to head off future lawsuits over sludging engines and failed transmissions by calling for more frequent changes. Something is telling them there are problems in the pipeline.

Personally, I change conventional oil every 3000 miles or every two years. Synthetic gets it at 5000 miles. Transmission I have always done at 50,000 miles. I always thought I was OCD. Changing it every two years is nuts.

I’ve heard that on AWD Fords the transfer case fluid needs to be changed at 30k miles which is interesting since older models don’t even have drain plugs.

I think it is looking for extra work for the dealership, and adding commissions for the service advisor. Why make a car that can go X miles and then tell customers the work should be done at the half way mark. Dealers feel ripped off by the manufacturers who call the shots.....they make most of their profit from servicing cars....dealers are trying to make as much as they can from the service department.

Exactly. I remember when quick oil change and lube places first started up....for many years they did basic work. Then slowly they put mileage stickers on which were half the recommended oil change level....fair enough to be extra safe....if you want. But then came wipers, coolant flush, gas filters....anything they could scare you into thinking you needed. This seems to be the same. Lots of professions now have courses in how to bill extra $$$s, vets, dentists, chiropractors to name a few....I am sure dealers can do the same.

2269,Aug-28,omarman,"This pic of Speed Demon 715 pulled me into the GM Authority article about the world's fastest piston engine car. It's powered by a methanol-fueled 557 cubic inch Chevy big block with two 88mm Precision turbochargers making 3,156 horsepower and 2,106 pound-feet of torque.

About 5 days before this record setting run Speed Demon had managed to hit 455 mph on just seven cylinders! A valve cover gasket failed which started an oil fire. Data revealed that cylinder #4 went lean and melted the piston.

The team had a smaller LS based engine available as a spare but decided to rebuild the big block with a spare piston and keep going for the record. Can't argue with the logic considering that the big block engine recorded a 455 mph exit speed even with a hole in the #4 piston! Amazing.
After making engine repairs, rebuilding a fire damaged wiring harness and resolving mechanical issues along the way Speed Demon Racing set a new AA/BFS record on Thursday August 13.

At another Chevy fan page I saw that a brand new 50th Anniversary 1957 Chevy convertible steel body with chassis is available for purchase now from CARS Inc.

Wonder if Team Speed Demon is still carrying around that spare LS engine?
A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing."

I would go with the second quote - $11,600 because he was more specific as to what he is going to do and the quote is reasonable compared to the other 2 quotes.

Also, he is starting from ground level up rather than reclaiming old asphalt which saves the other guy time and haul-away expense. Just my opinion, nyc! 🤓
I agree, I think #2s quote is the most complete without trying to make it sound like he is doing more than the others.
#3 has an extra step listed, use 5 ton then 10 ton.......assume the others said the same in one step.
#2 specifically says Supply and Place 1"" - 4"" of Gravel if necessary.
He describes exactly what he is doing in the last step with the Belgian Blocks.
I would check reviews too. #2's quote is lower but quite often the real professional guy has built his business over time, he has it paid off and he can make a good living even if he charges a bit less. He can be a professional that likes his work and doesn't have to make a killing.

I drive my ATS very little, it has yet to hit 10,000 miles after nearly 3 years of ownership. Despite that, I have somehow managed to scuff all 4 of its 18"" wheels, with the most recent being yesterday on the right rear when I made a right turn at a tight intersection and caught the nearside curb. This is my first car having such low-profile tires (40 aspect ratio on the front, 35 on the rear) and that gives very little protection to the rims. The first one I damaged was the RF about 3 weeks after getting the car when I pulled into a parking space. That annoyed me so much I took it to my tire shop and had them send it out to be refinished. The two on the left side both have marks on them that mystify me because you don't normally deal with curbs on that side and one of them has a mark on one of the spokes well away from the lip of the wheel, so who knows. It almost seems like a waste to refinish those all at this point since I have little doubt further scuffs and dings will occur. I do have the opportunity to do that when I have the winter wheels and tires are put on though, so I am still thinking it over.

Well, I was in a position coming off a lease where I had to get something and this one was a pretty good deal. I tried a few other cars and didn't particularly like them, and there really wasn't anything that I had the hots for. A couple of months earlier I was sorely tempted by a demo 2017 GTI at the dealer nearby, but after dithering too long it got sold so that was that. I knew going in that whatever I bought wouldn't get driven much although I wasn't counting on the health issues that have limited that even more. My thinking at the time was to get off the lease train, buy something and keep it for a while. Of course I hadn't counted on that itch I get whenever I've had a car for a while. As for the ATS itself it has been a great car, no issues whatsoever except for those self-inflicted ones with the wheels. I think it looks better than the sedans Caddy is offering today.

Some performers can't resist mixing their agenda with art. The Ventures have always been welcome relief from that trend over the years. Instrumental groups reach beyond language, social and political barriers. I've read that The Ventures outsold the Beatles in Japan.

A friend of mine went to see Jeff Beck at Vets Memorial who also gave a short uninspired performance due to ""health"" concerns. But a little known opening act stole the show anyway. My friend said the band was called Blue Oyster Cult and at the time I'd never heard of them.

I've seen Jeff Beck twice, since he's become ""elderly"". I think he was 66, the first time. Outdoors (though covered) and about 90 F. He killed it.

I would love to see Blue Oyster Cult, though I have no idea what shape they may be in, now.

Nostalgia shows are 50/50. Sometimes they mail it in, but in other ones they really bring back the magic.

My last concert was Michael Buble. We had seats in the lower level. We were familiar
with the seating in that venue because we went to annual ice skating Stars on Ice there,
so I bought tickets on StubHub, since tickets to anything are always sold out tot he
scalpers before the first phone rings when they go on sale.

I always liked his smooth sound, but this was a happy life, happy wife thing.
She wanted to go. And this ranked right up there with seeing A Chorus Line
at the Clowes Memorial Hall in Indianapolis from prime first row balcony seats earlier
in 1991.

Very enjoyable. The opening act was awful. Dragged on and dragged on.
Buble's sound was great.

Venue was Fifth Third Arena downtown Cincinnati.

Performances I wish I had gone to see were Elton John, Elvis Presley.

I did see the Supremes in an Armory fieldhouse on UC's campus.
I was much, much younger then and it was great. Not sure I can even
narrow down the year on that one.
UC Fieldhouse
Dave Mason, Bob Welch. Around 1978
The Kinks, John Cougar. Around 1981 (I was on-stage for John Cougar).

50/50 is right on, lately. for me:

Good show: Moody Blues, Steve Miller Band
A for effort, but...: Marshall Tucker Band, only one original member, Doug Gray struggled with his vocals (recent auto accident, likely along with age); David Crosby, show ended after 20 minutes due to illness.

I'll call The Who not nostalgia as they played a couple of new songs! And, rocked!

If you want my opinion, I’d look at some (at least 2) of the jobs they have done, then decide based on what you see. And don’t for one minute forget that they are prepared to negotiate. Negotiation is always built into their quote. How much, on a job that size, I’d say at least $500. Like we have learned in here...if you don’t ask, you don’t get.

A long time ago when I was single a young lady invited me to a concert by a popular group...I won't name the group here, though most would know it. They are sucky but this was a hot date.
Anyway, they played for about 20 minutes and then the lead singer said he had a sore throat, he couldn't sing any longer, and they had fulfilled their contract obligations so they were going, but they hoped we would come back when they came back to town.
Actually the lady in question put up such a good fight they did offer her another pair of tickets - but that put me off going to concerts for a long time. I haven't been burned for a long time so would go these days, but, I choose very carefully.
I tend to avoid concerts as they tend to be to loud. That being said the last big name I saw was Kenny Rogers at a casino in the upper part of the lower peninsula of Michican. It was a small venue and everyone was close to Mr. Rogers.

We bought the E when we were driving to and from Florida each year....1500 miles each way. It is comfortable on long trips, smooth, has lots of power, felt bigger and thus safer. I ordered it but it wasn't ready in time for the Florida trip so we flew to Florida, and decided that we were at a stage where flying suited us better. A few reasons but the trip was becoming more and more congested each year...major tie-ups can hold you up for hours.

Possible explanations. 10k miles in three years means you are not driving nearly often enough for muscle memory to take over routine driving chores. Second, you are probably beginning to lose your depth perception due to the aging process or your glasses prescription needs updating.

I drive my ATS very little, it has yet to hit 10,000 miles after nearly 3 years of ownership. Despite that, I have somehow managed to scuff all 4 of its 18"" wheels, with the most recent being yesterday on the right rear when I made a right turn at a tight intersection and caught the nearside curb. This is my first car having such low-profile tires (40 aspect ratio on the front, 35 on the rear) and that gives very little protection to the rims. The first one I damaged was the RF about 3 weeks after getting the car when I pulled into a parking space. That annoyed me so much I took it to my tire shop and had them send it out to be refinished. The two on the left side both have marks on them that mystify me because you don't normally deal with curbs on that side and one of them has a mark on one of the spokes well away from the lip of the wheel, so who knows. It almost seems like a waste to refinish those all at this point since I have little doubt further scuffs and dings will occur. I do have the opportunity to do that when I have the winter wheels and tires are put on though, so I am still thinking it over.
Maybe you should start looking at getting 4 wheels from the wreckers and save them until trade-in time.

I guess this falls in the grey area between CCBA & Cars & Conversations. Back in March I started getting quotes to rip up and repave my driveway which you have all seen (and commented on in my various car pics over the years)

Quote #1 - $11,725.00

Reclaim Existing Asphalt to Stabilize Base
Regrade Base Material & Compact
Apply & Compact Processed Gravel
Install 3"" Nominal Class 2 Asphalt
Reset Belgian Block & Backfill with Concrete 210'

Quote #2 - $11,600.00

Excavate & Remove Existing Driveway
Level, Grade, & Compact Gravel Base
Supply & Place 1"" - 4"" of Gravel if necessary
Supply & Place 3"" of Class 2 Asphalt (Compact to 2 1/2"")
Redo Belgian Block on Left side of the driveway to create pitch to drain water to back yard. Reset in Concrete

Quote #3 - $12,800.00

Excavate & Remove Old Driveway
Supply Gravel Base Material to meet grade
5 ton vibratory to pave
10 ton vibratory roller for sub-base
Pave 3"" of Class 2 Asphalt Compacted to 2 1/2""
Repair Belgian Blocks as needed

Questions? Comments. Suggestions?

My Driveway is about 2,500 square feet.
I would go with the second quote - $11,600 because he was more specific as to what he is going to do and the quote is reasonable compared to the other 2 quotes.

Also, he is starting from ground level up rather than reclaiming old asphalt which saves the other guy time and haul-away expense. Just my opinion, nyc! 🤓

Moody Blues at Timberwolf (Kings Island).

Bruce Hornsby and the Range with Bonnie Raitt at Fraze Pavilion in Dayton.

Joan Jett with Elvis Costello at Bogarts (Cincinnati). Kings of Leon at Bogarts (right before they blew up).

Hard to miss that! It has to be fixed, either before or when you take it in.........personally, I would take it in for a pre-inspection, see what the dealer would charge.......then comparison shop. But, if it is at all close, use the dealer even if it is more, so they can't deny it wasn't repaired to their standards.

We are very careful about our NEXUS....usually don't even buy liquor just so it doesn't send a red flag.
Once I was into this wine we could only buy in the U.S. The wine was only $11 a bottle, and I knew the duty at the border would be $5 a bottle.......X 12 bottles. Glad to pay $60 duty because if they sold the wine in Canada it would be at least double or $22 a bottle.

I come up to Canadian customs and am glad to declare my 12 bottles of wine, and the customs officer was doing paper work and told me to just drive through.

2374,Aug-23,Michaell,"Back when I was travelling for work a lot, we had a number of customers in Canada, and I would fly into YYZ frequently to teach to them. Since we were being paid for this work, going through customs was always dicey as Canada is not fond of their companies sending money to the US for professional services.

Once, I flew in on a Sunday afternoon and was detained by the Customs folks. This was not long after NAFTA (the original) was passed, so they were being extra careful with the screening. After some polite questioning, they determined that I could enter the country, but only after I paid a fine. A customs agent escorted me to an ATM to withdraw the cash to pay said fine. My receipt showed ""Minor Infractions of NAFTA Regulations"" (I may still have that paper somewhere in the basement).

The nice part is that I was able to expense the fine, and ended up making money in the process, due to the exchange rates.

While going through all of this, there was another American getting the same questioning, except he was exemplifying the ""Ugly American"" attributes in his responses. The customs folks didn't take to his attitude and calmly explained to him that since there were no more flights back to the US that evening, he could gladly spend the night in a holding cell while they got things sorted out.

I left before I learned his final disposition.

Exactly, and that rule applies going the other way too....Canada into the U.S. to do business. For a few years I was given a customer in Buffalo to call on. I was really trying to get them to buy more....but, said it was just a friendly drop in call.....once I was charged $5, some kind of charge to do any business in the U.S.

We got pulled aside for additional searching - not us, but the car. Back in the day those cars were frequently stolen, and maybe popular among drug dealers. They spent maybe 20 minutes searching it, and let us go. Funny thing, my friend always kept a fairly long knife in the driver's side door pocket.

Actually they might leave a coating that would help lubricate the surface along with the water and prevent the sticking that occurs when the wiper completely dries the windshield and friction increases causing the wiper to grab and then eventually let go with the flop that occurs. Irritating.

Default Solved Windshield Wiper Chatter
After many tries and much wasted money on expensive wiper arms, my problem with wiper chatter and streaking finally went away after buying a cheap wiper which was one inch shorter than the recommended size blade.

This was a BMW
Took car in SEVERAL times for this issue. Was told that my arms and such are working just fine. Its the blade itself, BMW blades dont work well apparently. BMW said all they would do is put new blades on, however, this is about the 4th set of blades that have done this. My SA suggested aftermarket blades. I would like to get some aftermarket blades, preferably good ones, like the bosch Icon blades but I cannot decipher if they will fit on my car.

Hello everyone,

I recently bought a 2020 Camry SE and noticed that the wipers would bounce and chatter when using intermittent speed during the rain. It only happens when the wipers come to the resting spot. I tried to duplicate the bouncing and chattering in my garage when it was dry but it doesn’t happen. Just happens when it’s raining.

I took it to the dealer to show them my videos and the technician looked at it and said it was normal. The service advisor suggested that it could be the wipers but was unable to replace them under warranty. I purchased my own wiper blades and it didn’t help.

I was wondering if anyone else had this issue.

2391,Aug-24,imidazol97,"I was surprised at the negative responses about RainX. I had wondered about the static friction effect where the wiper grabs the glass because the layer of water is completely removed by the previous ridges on the wiper edge. The RainX makes the glass repel the water evidenced by the water droplets beading up with their own surface tension.

I found that wiper blades on some of my cars always sit at the parked position tipped one way when they stop. The sun and time age the wiper in that position on one side. So when the blade starts to go up the windshield, instead of flipping the other direction, it is so slanted with the main edge on the up side, it will chatter.

On the return downstroke, the blade is in the proper position with the other minor edges wiping water away in advance of the main edge hitting the glass, and there was on chatter on that downstroke.

New wipers wouldn't exhibit this age problem. It would take some months even in the brutal sun of Broward to age wiper blades into this set shape and harden there.

I got so I'd push the blade the other way when it was parked and I was around the car, so the blade didn't take a ""set"" in that one position.

This was when I'd buy the good Walmart house brand wiper blade for 4$ or so and just replace them a couple times a year instead of buying $20 blades and trying to make them last.

Kinda reminds me of the time I was stopped in SC back around 1979 when I went to visit a friend who I worked with for a few years and transferred to a division in SC. I got caught in a speed trap coming around a curve on a new section of an interstate road. I was barely over 60 MPH on a posted 55 MPH speed limit and my PA plates didn't get me the benefit of the doubt so I was a sitting duck. The state cop politely comes to the window and asked how I was doing. I said, ""pretty good until you stopped me"". Mrs j and my sons damn near passed out. The cop gave me the option of paying a $20 fine right then and there, or following him to the magistrates office about 5 miles away. I gave him a 20 and I was on my way. I'm sure he turned it over to the the proper dept. when he returned to his barracks.

To this day my family likes to remind me of that day.

AOL.COM 21 mins ago

DETROIT (AP) — A young woman was discovered to be alive after she had been declared dead and taken to a Detroit funeral home, officials said.

The Southfield fire department said paramedics tried to revive the 20-year-old woman for 30 minutes Sunday.

“Given medical readings and the condition of the patient, it was determined at that time that she did not have signs of life,” the department said.

“The Oakland County medical examiner’s office was contacted and given the medical data,” the department said. “The patient was again determined to have expired and the body was released directly to the family to make arrangements with a funeral home of their choosing.”

But then came a startling discovery at James H. Cole funeral home: The woman was alive.

“Our staff confirmed she was breathing"" and called a Detroit emergency medical crew, the funeral home said.

The woman was taken to a hospital, WDIV-TV and The Detroit News reported. No other information on the location, her name or current condition was immediately available Monday.

“We couldn’t believe it,” said Dave Fornell, deputy commissioner of the Detroit fire department, who added that her heart rate was 80."

In the mirror I could see flashing red/blue lights off in the distance behind me. At the time I thought it was a rather slow moving fire/rescue vehicle.

After I pulled over and lit up the cigarette an unmarked Pontiac sedan with red/blue lights on the dash pulled in behind my car. A young guy wearing a dress shirt and tie walked up to my window and introduced himself as the county sheriff.

He was agitated and peppered me with a lot of questions. ""Do you know how long I've been chasing you? How fast were you going? Do you realize that you crossed a double yellow line back there?""

""Chasing me? But I just pulled over to smoke after I put the window down and heard a siren.""

It didn't occur to me that I was being ""chased"" by a car that far away. He got pretty angry but I tried to answer everything he wanted to know. He didn't ask for my license.

I told him that I did pass a line of 3 cars maybe 10 miles back or so but there was no double yellow line there. There was an edge in his voice when said that he was the middle car in that line and No, he wasn't talking about a double line there!

He said that I had passed another car after that and THAT'S where the double yellow line was you [non-permissible content removed]! But he explained that he was so far behind that he could not get up to speed before I had already passed the next car.

I didn't recall seeing double lines back there and I asked, politely, how he could be so sure about the lines since he said that he was pretty far behind the spot where it happened? Mistake. It finally occurred to me that my response was making the vein on his neck pop out. Well that and the part about how long it took him to catch up.

I wasn't resisting or trying to talk my way out of a ticket. But I had broken the rules when I questioned him instead of just answering yes sir, no sir, like that. So I took my license out of my wallet, apologized for everything and asked if I was ok to finish my smoke. He took my license and went back to his car where he stayed for a long time. When he came back he returned my license and told me that he was giving me a written warning for improper passing. He was much more calm by then. I did not mention anything about improper passing but I signed the warning and apologized again for the trouble.

I eventually quit smoking after that but I still like listening to Abraxas really loud. Hard to pick just one track but this one adds about 50 hp to any car you're driving.

""Dead' woman found to be breathing at Detroit funeral home

AOL.COM 21 mins ago

DETROIT (AP) — A young woman was discovered to be alive after she had been declared dead and taken to a Detroit funeral home, officials said.

The Southfield fire department said paramedics tried to revive the 20-year-old woman for 30 minutes Sunday.

“Given medical readings and the condition of the patient, it was determined at that time that she did not have signs of life,” the department said.

“The Oakland County medical examiner’s office was contacted and given the medical data,” the department said. “The patient was again determined to have expired and the body was released directly to the family to make arrangements with a funeral home of their choosing.”

But then came a startling discovery at James H. Cole funeral home: The woman was alive.

“Our staff confirmed she was breathing"" and called a Detroit emergency medical crew, the funeral home said.

The woman was taken to a hospital, WDIV-TV and The Detroit News reported. No other information on the location, her name or current condition was immediately available Monday.

“We couldn’t believe it,” said Dave Fornell, deputy commissioner of the Detroit fire department, who added that her heart rate was 80.
That happened to me once.

Kinda reminds me of the time I was stopped in SC back around 1979 when I went to visit a friend who I worked with for a few years and transferred to a division in SC. I got caught in a speed trap coming around a curve on a new section of an interstate road. I was barely over 60 MPH on a posted 55 MPH speed limit and my PA plates didn't get me the benefit of the doubt so I was a sitting duck. The state cop politely comes to the window and asked how I was doing. I said, ""pretty good until you stopped me"". Mrs j and my sons damn near passed out. The cop gave me the option of paying a $20 fine right then and there, or following him to the magistrates office about 5 miles away. I gave him a 20 and I was on my way. I'm sure he turned it over to the the proper dept. when he returned to his barracks.

To this day my family likes to remind me of that day.

I've seen the Rolling Stones, Elton John, Kenny Chesney (not by choice haha), Bill Joel, and others at the professional sports stadiums. The Rolling Stones were at Heinz Field and while the music was great we were also in the nosebleed seats so not really an intimate experience. Then there's the amphitheater located in the middle of nowhere that's a PITA to get in and out of. The only shows I'll go to see there are bands I absolutely want to see...Rush for example.

2417,Aug-25,graphicguy,"Speaking of concerts, every year the outdoor concert venue, to afore mentioned Riverbend (actually on the banks of the OH River) I spoke about had a concert series. You bought a series of concerts for the season. They had several different “tiers”. Cheapest tier was in the “lawn” section, where, which is a grassy area where you could hear the concert and also open to the elements, but had to rely on large video screens to actually see the performance. There were a few other “tiers” where you had a seat under roof. The closer to the stage, the more expensive the ticket.

The top tier, with private restrooms (very important to a female), private bar area, were the best seats in the house and were also the most expensive (by a goodly amount). The more seasons in a row you purchased the series, the better and better your seats became. Saw lots of good acts there....

-Crosby, Stills, Nash (3x)
-Neil Diamond (2X)
-Santana (meh)
-The Eagles (Joe Walsh is a guitar stud)
-Creed
-Stone Temple Pilots (really good)
-Willie Nelson and Family (also good)
-Lots of others

Just excellent, the band was very talented and Knopfler was genius. Most were hit and miss for me. I remember taking a date to see Loverboy in the early '80s, a band I didn't really like much but she wanted to see them. The opening act was a guy neither of us had heard of named Bryan Adams and Loverboy had a tough time following him. We also caught Neil Young a year or two later when thanks to our ignorance we didn't know he was in his country & western phase and that was a big disappointment. Opening act that time was The Judds who put on a better show. Some near-nostalgia acts like The Beach Boys in the mid-80s were entertaining enough, and Chicago a few years later were surprisingly good. By the time we got acts like Paul McCartney and the Stones to come here I was past the stage of wanting to stand in the open air with 30,000 strangers so I passed. I did have a chance to see Rush here in maybe 2011 or 12 when they came through and didn't go because I really wasn't a big fan, but now wish I had.

Even counting just basic heating — and not all the other stuff that requires electricity— it is hard for a wood stove to heat many of today’s Large, high-ceiling homes. When we had our prolonged outage, combined with below 0 temps, the wood stove couldn’t come close to being sufficient. It was the holidays too so we had a full house. A friend who had power took our dogs, the vet took our cats, a couple of us with my 90 year old father camped in a hotel — one of the last rooms available — and the rest stayed in various college buildings that had power (about a third of the buildings did, including 2 dorms). It was crazy, but a great story to recount later, especially the heroic journey to pick up our daughter from the airport — normally a 45 minute drive that took 4 hours or more — and then she had to stay in a friend’s dorm room along with the friend’s parents! But it was a one-time thing, and other outages never lasted longer than a day, and never in such cold temperatures.
My grandfather had a very old house with one furnace located in the basement. Probably originally wood, then coal and finally oil by the time I came along. They heated two floors (10 foot ceilings) by having a series of grates in the floor/ceiling which hot air could rise up from the basement. No fans just convection. Probably uneven heating but I never noticed since I was busy getting yelled at for opening and closing the grates so I could spy on relatives from upstairs.

On the contrary you can cook on top of a wood stove, heat water too. Use candles for light and tell ghost stories around the fire. As a kid when we would camp out in the winter we would put things like milk and eggs in an insulated cooler with a jug of water. The insulation and the latent heat of the water would keep things from freezing down to zero F. (-18 C).
Sounds like fun......might be able to heat a bit of water....not enough for a shower or bath unless you have one of those large kettles and make a fire under it.

76 cents and expected to sink lower. When we bought the Florida place the Cdn dollar was 94 cents. A low dollar is good for the economy, you can make goods for a lower cost, and then export them and sell at a lower price....for example cars.

It is not just exchange rate. The quoted system is $7500 Canadian. At .76, that’s $5700. And we are still talking about 14kw for $5700. This one is 17kw for $4500. Is it really so hard to believe the installer is marking up the equipment? He’s not doing anything wrong. I’m merely pointing it out.

Exactly.....$6000 Cdn is as oldfarmer calculated $4500 USD....that one is $4000. But, these things aren't discounted up here, and we want to buy it from the guy who is going to install it. There are a lot of steps to coordinate, gas line has to be hooked up, a pad made, wiring in place etc., so I'd rather pay the guy installing it more so he is responsible for everything.

About the Canada pricing... is there a sales tax on the Canadian purchase of the product and other parts? and on the service (labour) for installing same?

When we last visited Canada long, long ago, there was a 15% sales tax and then IIRC another low percent sales tax for the area where we were visiting, the province?

Yes, there is a provincial tax ( PST) and a federal tax (GST) and in most provinces these have been combined into Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) which in my province is 13%. Adds quite a bit to a $1000 item!

I think it’s more a factor of convenience.

I have two relatively close independent hardware stores. Do they have the selection as Lowe’s? No, but they carry Weber grills and not 6 brands of grills that essentially do the same thing as Lowe’s does.

Local hardware stores are easy to navigate and offer useful advice for any home repair or maintenance need I might have.

What I can’t do at my local hardware stores is buy 30 sheets of dry wall, or New flooring for the whole house, or get a new dishwasher.

But, for everything else, it’s easier and more convenient to go to my local store. Plus, they’ll actually walk you to the exact aisle or bin to find what you need. Try getting that at Lowe’s.

Each has their place!
I agree that each has it's place and I'm not knocking the big box stores.

Home Depot will be happy to sell you a Weber grill for less then the local guy will but when you need a new igniter for it Home Depot won't stock it or probably even know what it is but the local guy who lost the sale on the Weber because his was 15.00 more, HE will stock the igniter!

Like the tennis balls....$2.40 in the U.S., $5.99 in Canada....hard to explain. Costs for everything are higher in Canada, shipping, wages, taxes, cost to advertise, rent a warehouse, etc. Economy of scale, the country has more land than the USA but the same population as California. The difference in the dollar is a big factor....30% off the top. Another is buying power....90% greater in the U.S. We have really bad relations with China too....so that is a hindrance. I believe Kohler generators are mostly made in the U.S. with parts from China and India....who knows what taxes and duties are added in.......and shipping these things to Canada costs a lot more.

Because there is less competition we don't have the low profit high volume dealers....I would imagine there is a branch office in Canada, they pay for the units, then add in their costs and profit margin. The same happens with TVs and computers, generally we pay the dollar difference plus a premium for being in a large lightly populated country, with major health benefits. It is the way it is, and nothing can be done about it. We buy most of our clothes in Florida because even with the exchange we probably pay half what we would pay in Canada. I do believe we buy fewer goods, and try to get by with things we really want or need.....have to be more selective.

I remember when I was a kid in the '60s/early '70s and used to go with my parents on the annual road trip vacation to New England. Back then the value of what you could bring back across the border was $25/person unless you were in the US more than a week or 10 days, at which point it went up to $125 IIRC. It was exactly like what Driver talked about - we would buy clothes and then wear them immediately, so that they would be clearly used and/or dirty if they inspected our suitcases. The same with shoes, which were a really hot item to buy back then in Maine when Dexter and Bass shoe stores were doing well. Booze was about 1/3 of the price there than it was here in regular stores, forget about the New Hampshire and duty-free shops which were even cheaper. Same with tobacco.

The night before we crossed the border was when the parents did their strategizing in the motel room. Mom always found the US a good place to buy linens and towels in those days so those would get declared when you crossed the border. Anything else that could plausibly be deemed purchased in Canada or on a previous trip was not. You pretty much had to do it given the absurdly low allowance the Canadian govt allowed. I will never forget crossing back into Canada at Calais, ME/St. Stephen, NB one time with them when the agent decided to go through the car looking for whatever. He found nothing until he opened our Coleman cooler in the trunk and found a single can of Schlitz that dad had neglected to drink over the previous few days.

These folks are doing just what I would do if I lived in a place where costs were higher and I had the opportunity for a day trip into the US and shopping at a multifaceted outlet mall saving lots of money, then gasing up the car on the way back home. IIRC, the gas prices around that area were lower than other parts along I90 on our way up to Niagara FAlls.

I was, however, just stunned by the mess left. Many didn't bother trying to find a trash barrel for their castoff shoes and clothes and boxes. They just left them on the pavement. I'd never seen that at even a discount mall.

And many of the purchasers may not have been Canadians, because the tourist mix at the Falls area was yuuuuge as one might say.

The problem may be MB puts a special coating on the windshield. I have trouble finding if the idea that they are giving their windows a special infrared or other coating on the surface or if that's just sizzle used to sell the steak.

In an earlier post I asked if MB used the same linkage setup for more than one model. That's a part that easily adapted to various applications since it's hidden except for the arms. The high ratio of the resistance over the force movement in the lever makes it susceptible to the static friction being much greater than the moving friction when the wiper successfully clears all the water and rubs on the glass. The moving end of the wiper goes a large distance compared to the small distance the lever arm hidden under the cowl moves.

I searched for ""windshield wipers low friction"" or similar words but decided not to post any of what I found. It would make for posts over 125 word limit.

Many have worked on various materials and patented the results.

But I still think it goes back to the linkage and the surface of the glass.

I'd try cleaning the windshield with a nice sudsy Dawn mixture, avoiding getting any on the painted surface because it's a great wax remover to use when using a clay bar.

Wipe the wiper blades with that or isopropyl alcohol.

I'd recommend Barkeepers Friend as a cleaner or very fine steel wool and soap, but some try to say there's a special coating ""on"" MB windshields to do something rather than a coating in the plastic layer between the two glass layers.

And wait for the next big rain.

There's hope, because if I recall correctly, Fintail found a type of wiper blade insert that solved the problem pretty much on his MB. However, different areas of the country may present different problems with the windshield and what's on it.

*Got to the border at 5:30 a.m., one line had about 6 cars, the other had a sign that said ""Fast Lane"". I asked if everyone had their NEXXUS cards....they did so I went to the fast lane which was empty.
*The U.S. customs guy didn't like that we used the Fast Lane...it was for trucks though there was no NEXXUS lane.
*He sent us inside. The customs guy was angry asking me if I had studied the rules in the 2 inch thick Nexxus rule book. He told me he was typing up a report and this had better not happen again. He could make it so none of us would ever get into the U.S. again - don't forget we have a home there, I didn't want to mention that.
*We had a train to catch, he told me to sit down next to the other 3 while he typed up his report - I am thinking this guy must have had a big argument with his wife this morning! BTW, if you don't know....they have absolute and total control, you can't win with them, they can do whatever they want, even take your car apart.
*He put on his latex gloves and that was really scary as he walked toward me. He walked past me thank goodness and went out to the car. My SIL was going to bring an apple to eat on the way....that would have got us barred for life if she did that, I didn't know if it was in the suitcase.
*He came inside, typed some more, called me over and lectured me again about reading the 2 inch thick manual and told me again how he could bar me from ever getting into the U.S. again. I had to fill out a document saying I wasn't bringing any produce into the country, I got this far so I said NO and hoped my SIL forgot the apple.
*We raced out to the car and I sped to the train station where we just made it to our train before it left the station. You could see he took everything out of our suitcases and threw it back in....a total mess.
*I asked my SIL why she would bring an apple across the border and she said they buy groceries in Port Huron so she bought the apple in the U.S., she should be able to return it to the U.S. I explained it doesn't work that way, they don't know where she bought the apple.

The incident has never been mentioned, haven't had problems at the border since....I wonder if they really try to scare you when you first get your NEXXUS card, to keep you in line.

Do you remember where the discussion was about the redesign? I'd be curious to know more about that.

This issue has been a thing for years. On my first W212, also my first new car, I took it in within 6 weeks of purchase for juddery wipers. They gave me a new set under warranty, no problem. A month later, juddery again, and again they gave me a new set. Third time, they told me pretty much the ""they all do that"" and to deal with it. To their credit, they also checked the wiper arm angle/tension etc. They probably did all they were allowed.

At least with that car, I was able to build my own solution, but it isn't possible on later models.

Mike, as a person who lived under a similar regime for around 20 years, I can tell you this is a very typical response of these types of governments to any kind of crisis. It's basically exact opposite to what you get with free press, when reports will often become quickly exaggerated (usual motive would be profit from watching scary news, or getting political cover for requesting a gigantic disaster relief). In countries like China or Russia it basically works that at every level of the government, there is less and less bad news (truth) reported upward for fear of retaliation. Doesn't matter whether it's a toxic spill, industrial accident, or epidemic, the reported effect goes down and the message is ""we are on top of it, don't worry about it"". Central government may often have no idea how bad things are on the ground in first few hours/days, until they send their own trusted people to see it for themselves. That doesn't prevent them from hiding whatever remnants of truth they know, of course.

Exactly.....about 30% less in U.S. dollars.....$11k is probably about $8k USD all in. 20k is not what he recommended....20k is the standard for a 2000 sq ft house, but because of transfer switches and because there are only 2 adults etc he says 14k is sufficient.
For example.....first plan was to put the lines to the unit under a sidewalk, that would have added $600 more a gas fitting to the unit and in the house.....since he can put it on the other side of the house that cost is eliminated, no sidewalk to go under. Each house could have variables.

Hard to run your stove, hot water, light bulbs or TV from a wood fireplace. Some refrigerated items may not do too well if they freeze....milk, eggs, possibly cheese, lettuce, tomatoes for example.

Don't forget that some of that cost will be recouped if you ever sell the house as it will help resale value. Here on the coast the risk of power outage is highest now through early October when hurricane season peaks. When we've had a couple of bad ones power can be out for anywhere from a day to two weeks depending on where you are. You won't freeze but your food goes bad and it is no fun at all.

Even from the front you think it is a Bentley because of the wings on the emblem...I don't think the name is on the car except on the trunk where it says G80.

It looks really long in real life....I guess the same as an S Class.

Wouldn’t a wood stove be cheaper with potentially unlimited fuel? (Think about using your neighbor’s trees). If it’s freezing put your food out on the porch.
Even counting just basic heating — and not all the other stuff that requires electricity— it is hard for a wood stove to heat many of today’s Large, high-ceiling homes. When we had our prolonged outage, combined with below 0 temps, the wood stove couldn’t come close to being sufficient. It was the holidays too so we had a full house. A friend who had power took our dogs, the vet took our cats, a couple of us with my 90 year old father camped in a hotel — one of the last rooms available — and the rest stayed in various college buildings that had power (about a third of the buildings did, including 2 dorms). It was crazy, but a great story to recount later, especially the heroic journey to pick up our daughter from the airport — normally a 45 minute drive that took 4 hours or more — and then she had to stay in a friend’s dorm room along with the friend’s parents! But it was a one-time thing, and other outages never lasted longer than a day, and never in such cold temperatures.

Exactly.....about 30% less in U.S. dollars.....$11k is probably about $8k USD all in. 20k is not what he recommended....20k is the standard for a 2000 sq ft house, but because of transfer switches and because there are only 2 adults etc he says 14k is sufficient.
For example.....first plan was to put the lines to the unit under a sidewalk, that would have added $600 more a gas fitting to the unit and in the house.....since he can put it on the other side of the house that cost is eliminated, no sidewalk to go under. Each house could have variables.
14K - $5999.00 (50amps NG)
ATS 200 - $1749.00 ( I guess it includes a new Cadillac - I think that is the panel)
Electrical Installation – $2500 approximate, not to exceed
Gas Installation – $1000.00 appr

Hard to run your stove, hot water, light bulbs or TV from a wood fireplace. Some refrigerated items may not do too well if they freeze....milk, eggs, possibly cheese, lettuce, tomatoes for example.
I agree, it is like ultra expensive insurance. Looks like we won't be going to Florida this winter, so that pays for about half of the generator....the rest is convenience, and it could be life saving....protection against severe cold and getting really ill.
On the contrary you can cook on top of a wood stove, heat water too. Use candles for light and tell ghost stories around the fire. As a kid when we would camp out in the winter we would put things like milk and eggs in an insulated cooler with a jug of water. The insulation and the latent heat of the water would keep things from freezing down to zero F. (-18 C).

2527,Aug-19,driver100,"This article says chatter is caused by the angle of the blades...which can be changed;
The most common problem with chattering wiper blades is not the blade --it's the angle that the blade swipes across the windshield. If the blade is chattering on the down stroke, then the end of the wiper arm has to be bent so the rubber wiper edge will trail slightly. If the chatter is on the up stroke, then again, a simple bend in the arm should take care of the problem. The slight bend is made with a small adjustable wrench, slipping the wrench over the arm an inch down from where the blade connects to the arm. I have never had any problems with the Bosch blades and sold many over the years. The new generation of frameless beam style blades seems to the best. The use of some rain clearing glass products will also cause chatter during light rain drizzle.

Like they say, if they can send a man to the moon....they should be able to make a windshield wiper that works properly. Or, maybe in Europe they don't worry about such things as chatter.

I've had a couple of lease inspections the last few years. In 2014 I figured they would ding me for damages on my Regal Turbo. About a year prior to lease-end I hadn't noticed a tallish curb in a parking lot and cut the corner a bit too close. It impacted the underside of the right rocker panel and bent a section of it upward slightly. It always bugged me but like your case you had to be looking for it to notice, and the inspector didn't. The only thing he noted were a couple of wheel scuffs and it went back without a hitch. I might be tempted to take my chances if it is as subtle as you say, then feign surprise if it gets picked up.

BMW used to send lessees a clear plastic sheet with concentric circled printed on it. If the damage fit inside the smallest circle there was no charge. I forget what the price structure was. I hated lease turn-ins and wished that we sent everyone to a third party for inspections. Most lessees were great but there were a few that were just impossible to deal with.

They cover almost every possibility......they all have to do with the wiper. Some are temporary problems that will fix themselves. Seems the amount of pressure and the angle are major concerns. Since RainX doesn't make one in that size maybe another premo make does. Some suggest taking the arm off and putting it back on again....or just turn the radio up!

I think it’s more a factor of convenience.

I have two relatively close independent hardware stores. Do they have the selection as Lowe’s? No, but they carry Weber grills and not 6 brands of grills that essentially do the same thing as Lowe’s does.

Local hardware stores are easy to navigate and offer useful advice for any home repair or maintenance need I might have.

What I can’t do at my local hardware stores is buy 30 sheets of dry wall, or New flooring for the whole house, or get a new dishwasher.

But, for everything else, it’s easier and more convenient to go to my local store. Plus, they’ll actually walk you to the exact aisle or bin to find what you need. Try getting that at Lowe’s.

My fear is that there are few scuffs on the trim of the front passenger door and the trailing edge as well. I am thinking of not having that done and just focusing on the worst of it. The marks on the front door are non-issues but if they see the whole thing I'm afraid they will try and charge for all of it.

This article says chatter is caused by the angle of the blades...which can be changed;
The most common problem with chattering wiper blades is not the blade --it's the angle that the blade swipes across the windshield. If the blade is chattering on the down stroke, then the end of the wiper arm has to be bent so the rubber wiper edge will trail slightly. If the chatter is on the up stroke, then again, a simple bend in the arm should take care of the problem...

Like they say, if they can send a man to the moon....they should be able to make a windshield wiper that works properly. Or, maybe in Europe they don't worry about such things as chatter.
@mike I'm not sure whether someone has already mentioned replacing the wiper blade motor(s). While such a radical approach may not cure the problem, it's worth a try. Take a look at some of the many YouTube videos to see if it is worth the trouble. Good luck."

I would deduce that the problem is more likely a windshield wiper problem....maybe you should take it up with the wiper maker. It isn't the design, as very few cars seem to have the problem. Could it be a defective windshield.........how often is it the windshields fault on a new car, especially if it has been cleaned etc?

Maybe the wiper company should be made aware of the problem and they may have a solution, or be willing to try another pair.

2582,Aug-18,dino001,"I noticed that chatter tends to become more likely in light rain than heavy, when the wiper goes over a dry surface. Worn wipers tend to chatter more often than new ones. It can also vary with speeds, I've seen more chattering at really high speeds when air resistance is much heavier and can create issues. Overall it can be a fairly complex problem to solve and wipers may sometimes chatter when in a very specific combination of rain intensity, vehicle speed, wear and the manufacturers may not be able to eliminate all ranges. However, they should cover some basics, like genuine wiper blade should work well in ""normal rain at typical speed"" condition, that much is clear.

My first 212, a pre-facelift car, did it. I got 2 sets of blades under warranty, they adjusted the tension/angle on the arms, then told me that's just how it is. I read on a forum where a guy took apart the stock (Valeo IIRC) blade holders and inserted Bosch rubber. I did this, problem solved.

Unfortunately with the facelift, the wiper arm/blade holder design changed, and this isn't possible, or at least nobody has found a solution. The problem is some of these aftermarket wipers can cost $50 a set, and it might take several sets to do real research. If anyone wants to donate to my fund, I can do some research. Until then, it will take Rain-X nearly every time it rains, or usage of the factory (or Rain-X, I suppose) fluid often in the rain."

Oh year, my email provider had heard of a few cases of their system stripping the active part of an email. I looked over the source code of the delivered email and saw that Barracude (the commercial antivirus, not the vehicle) had rated the email as dangerous, but the email provider here said if Barracuda had disliked it, I wouldn't have seen any email, let alone an empty one.

So I set up email on my phone using an app. There I was able to see the link CFA demanded I click. Most companies would put a second method in their email to get to the response in a text formate. E.G., Microcenter in many of their advertising emails says if I can't see the images, I should click on this link in the email and I'm taken to a webpage version of the advertisement.

At least Mike got a timely response from MB was my point in the earlier post here.

I'm just astounded that someone with engineering ability hasn't found the problem and a cure for the MB chattering wipers problem. The chattering is coming from variations in friction of the wiper material against the glass: high friction which lets go and the wiper jumps with low friction over the heavy water and then catches again with a high friction occurring again.

Fintail is familiar with this occurring on several MB. Are they all related models that use the same pattern for the linkage in terms of the mechanical advantage in the levers involved.

No, since I left they’ve gone all computer nutty with all instructions done by email. route bidding is totally online this year because of Covid. I had refused to sign up for their network back then on the principle that I shouldn’t be forced to buy and maintain computers and internet service for their benefit.

The V6 Stingers are definitely aimed at a much more performance-oriented enthusiast demographic. They are also available in RWD and the AWD system is RWD biased. I’m not saying the Lincoln is bad at what it’s designed to do, because it isn’t, but I honestly cannot imagine anyone with more than half a brain cross-shopping the two. I’d say the closest car to the Stinger V6 models is the 440i Gran Coupe- and in that case the Stinger is extremely competitive- especially considering its price.
No disagreement. RB, did you ever get the chance to test drive a Stinger? Nice day yesterday, so went for a drive in the back roads along the Great Miami River. Had a blast. I’m still amazed how well the car accelerates, steers, handles and how well balanced the Stinger is.

While most of my cars have had a sunroof, I can’t say I used them much. The Stinger’s roof hole? Use it all the time! Not sure why that is other than it doesn’t buffer nearly as much as the others.

I remember it being a ton of fun to toss around. Not very quick (as a matter of fact, it was downright slow), but the engine made a nice “Italian” sound right behind my ears, given it was mid-engine.

Quality (even for the time) was abysmal. Doors shut like they were made from a roll of Reynolds wrap. Very slick shifter and light, easy to use clutch.

It’s funny how after working hard for many years you still feel the need. Working the part time job is perfect but whenever they offer extra hours I feel compelled to sign up. Then I ask myself, “what am I try so hard for”? It’s not like I’m bucking for a promotion. I guess after working two jobs for so many years I feel guilty turning down opportunities.
I know. It’s crazy, isn’t it? I think after traveling so much for my job, for so many years, being in the thick of the business hustle and bustle, it’s a little bit of a shock to the system to do a hard stop.

Been hustling for a buck for so long, it’s hard to just stop, regardless of if I need it or not.

I’ve mentioned my friend who got nailed for a DUI but was able to legal out of it a while ago. He can’t seem to take a step without it being in a cow pie. He’s been in a protracted divorce procedure with his estranged wife for about 2 years. He inherited quite a bit of money from his parents when they both passed. This was about 5-6 years ago. He turned around and bought a high buck home on a nice parcel of land in a trendy part of Southwestern OH.

He’s a Mechanical Engineer with an MBA....a highly desirable combo. He was out of a job for about a year, for no other reason than he desperately needed to get his life together.

We got together last week for dinner. He was regaling me with how he’s nearly penniless. He lives in a $450K house, on acres of prime land, and worries if he can pay the mortgage. Apparently, the estranged wife is owed whatever equity they have/had in the house. Plus, he now has a good paying job, and is forking over alimony, which is a crazy amount, regardless of how much you make.

The answer is obvious. Sell the house in a hot real estate market and settle all debts. He said he was emotionally attached to the house, and doesn’t want to.

I’ve been divorced for decades. So, the laws have changed. Plus, I had sole custody of my son, and my ex had a job where she made as much as me. So, there were no protracted or significant dollars changing hands.

I live a very comfortable life, but the way things are today, for the first time in my life, I’m worried about a catastrophe that can wipe out everything I’ve worked so hard to attain. I guess that’s why I’m still hustling a little bit.

My friend? As they say, “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make them drink”.

On other brands no info seems to come from sources that are credible. They're just intuition explanations.

Long ago a leSabre forum said the last 50 miles average mileage was used by the computer to predict DTE.

But the more recent driving style and fuel used in the last few tens or miles determines the calculated distance the fuel will last.

With the DTE, have just found it interesting how it works especially since it changed drastically when I changed the miles I go each week. It's truly been a win/win/win since I got a gig closer to home. Having no more tolls and using minimal petrol is a real nice change to be honest.

The Stinger is still in the running, but it will have to be a RWD GT1 or better unless Kia decides to put a mechanical LSD and D-AWD(adjustable torque split) and decent rubber on another AWD model. I was planning to test drive an Indigo Edition that has D-AWD but I discovered Kia installs all-season ""Grand Touring"" Primacy tires on it and reduces the top speed as a result. Hard pass. Why Kia didn't put the Pilot Sport 4S on it like the GTS is beyond me. At the very least least Kia could have installed Pilot Sport A/S 3+ tires which are W or Y speed rated and it would not have necessitated cutting the top speed.
So- I will eventually try one if a RWD V6 Stinger shows up, but I suspect the ""RWD is lethal!"" belief held by so many borderline sentient vehicle operators will keep RWD Stingers away from my part of the US.

I’ve always been smart, at least since I dropped out of Boy Scouts when I was 13.

there is absolutely no chance I would ever convince my wife to do tent camping like that. even an RV would be a tough sell.
My wife too. She said ""I don't want an RV, but if we do get one, I like the looks of an Airstream"" Bingo! We got a used Airstream and tried camping. We like it. Sleeping in your own bed, using your own bathroom and taking the little dog are easy. We liked it so much that we skipped the ""2 foot-itis"" and sold our 25' and got a 30' model. The extra room is nice.

2674,Aug-16,ab348,"Airstreams are cool and I suppose both it and RVs are considered ""camping"" but to me they seem quite different from sleeping in a pop-up trailer camper or a tent on the ground. Not the least of which because the former at least protects you from nocturnal visits by bugs and wildlife.

I have a mental bias against Airstreams only due to traumatic events in my youth on our family road vacations in the '60s as a little kid. In those days there were few expressways up here and in Northern New England as main highways and we would dread getting stuck behind a Wally Byam caravan of Airstreams on a 2-lane highway. ""*&!@%! peanut trailers!"" my mom would complain from her front-seat passenger position as my dad struggled to find a place to pass them all. Lots of white-knuckle overtaking.

Friday was hell at the new job. We onboarded a ton of employees on my projects and payroll was overwhelmed. There was data all over the place and getting payroll sorted was a nightmare. Vlookups into several sheets, etc etc. Well I made my first mistake at the new job. Forgot to reapply a filter in Excel and uploaded some junk data which made accounting freak.

So lesson 1 - watch your filters in Excel

Lesson 2 - If you are cheating cooking ribs in the slow cooker, don’t forget about them or you will have pulled pork

Lesson 3 - (this one from Mrs TJC). I’m sitting at the pool with my son as it wasn’t a great beach day. Wife headed back on the golf cart to get my daughter a snack. No less than ten minutes later my neighbor comes to the pool and says your wife needs you she is cut up really bad.

I leave all my stuff there, grab my son and my neighbor drives me back to my house. I walk in and take one look at her leg and knew we had to get the hospital.

She stepped on the stool and the crappy particle board seat broke and leg went through catching a screw. 30 stitches and a T-dap shot.

Thanks....

Just an update, and hopefully the last you’ll hear me whine about this....

Not the wife, but the Husband called me last night telling me they couldn’t get a mechanic to sign off on the car’s travel worthiness in the time frame I requested but they would pay for a meal for me to transport the car, anyway.

I politely declined the transport. He wanted to argue with me some more. Finally I told him...”thanks for thinking of me, but my decision is final”. Husband said he was going to tell all of his friends what a poor business person I was. I hung up. I was relaying this scenario to my son. He suggested that in certain cultures, this sort of “negotiation” is common. As I said, “it’s not common with me”.

For a few hundred dollars in profit, this isn’t worth the hassle. I blocked his phone number.

The Kia has a rear with eyes that are slits looking back at me following it and has a snarl on its upper lip along with canine teeth that could bite down at the bottom/ Aggressive without being off putting.

The other car, while having a similar oval outline to the rear, has a Meh blank face looking back at me following it.

They are both red, however.

What is the main difference between Stinger and MKZ?
Two Sedans with more similarities, such as the body structure, fuel economy, ground shadow size, and maximum occupancy, than differences, like the starting price, horsepower, and height. First of all, the 2018 Kia Stinger is priced $3,270 lower compared to the base MSRP of the 2017 Lincoln MKZ. Also, the 2018 Stinger pulls more horsepower than the 2017 MKZ. And finally, the roofline of the Stinger is lower than the MKZ's. Among similarities are the body structure, fuel economy, ground shadow size, and maximum occupancy.

A very fair comparison. If I had nothing better to do and needed a new car, I would consider cross shopping the two. I like the Lincoln as a luxury car for a fair price....they are pretty large, comfortable, solid, high content and look pretty sleek. I like the Stinger for it's high performance per dollar. If i am not sure whether performance or comfort is more important I would possibly compare the two.

That is what the DTE in the Enclave does. After filling the tank it usually hovers around 390 miles. If I do a straight highway run of 60 miles or so it will only drop about 40 miles. The DTE is simple math in the Enclave based on tank capacity and the recorded average MPG.

Claims he got on I-71 NB and merged to far left lane at 80 mph (65 speed limit). Looked up and saw a RAM pickup truck gaining really fast even though host was going 80. Claims he got over a lane and then the truck pulled over in front of him and locked up the brakes, apparently for host to RAM him? But host says he's a great driver and his car was so agile he avoided all the attempts for contact from RAM driver.

Went 5 miles or so to I-275 and took usual ramp right to EB. Saw RAM truck next to him on berm. Truck performed a pit maneuver. And all came to a stop. Host got out of car with CC in hand, but driver was out and went to nearby exit where is beat a man taking him out of his 250, fled south toward Cincy on highway and ended up RAMming through closed garage doors at business.

I somehow suspect there's more to initial interaction otherwise why would RAM driver pick this one speeder out. Maybe because he was in a Porsche?

No pictures of Porsche. Host says he's shopping for a new car now. He used to do ads for Porsche and this was a 2015, so it may have been a perk at the time.

Talk show host says he was told the driver was arguing with his father hence the floating anger.

Yesterday on the highway just north of NYC traffic suddenly slowed down. Everyone was switching lanes to go around a beat up Civic that was going about 20 under the limit with his flashers on.

As I caught up and passed him I noticed he had the dreaded “drift“ set up on the rear wheels with high inward camber. It seems he had not considered the wear characteristics of driving on the highway because he was tossing chunks of tread off the rear tires. I was surprised that his tires were still holding air.

Assuming he made it home I don’t think he would be doing any drifting.

The radar cops lurk just at the end of the highway behind a conveniently-placed building on the first intersection and have been raking in tickets there for some time. The one this week was particularly good, an 18 y-o caught doing 137 km/h (84mph) in the 30 mph zone. I can imagine his life will be hellish for the next while. Of course this has caused the cycling activists and pearl-clutchers on local social media to decry all the nuts behind the wheel who are out to get them, and ponder why we don't have laws requiring limiters preventing cars from exceeding 70mph.

And when it's done, daddy's lawyer will still get a certain demographic out of any accountability.

Locally, 99% of enforcement is speed-related, while in my anecdotal experience, red light running, distracted driving, non-signaling, dumb U-turn making, LLCing etc, is off the charts - it's like those few weeks when people stayed home more made the drones forget how to drive.

Unfortunately they probably know you don't have 22 more potential purchases left in you; and their bean counter made a bean counting decision not in your favor.

I do think age played a part in getting Audi to cover my AC issues at 53,000 miles, technically 3,000 after warranty. The A3 was designed to bring younger folk into the Audi family, and saying ""screw you about the AC"" wasn't the way to achieve that goal. Good call, I've since bought 2 more S models and a CPO A model. No way that would have happened if Audi told me to pound sand.

Sorry to hear that but not surprised. If they replaced the windshield they would lose money on the sale of the car, and it might not fix the problem. I don't know how loud the noise is but it is a bit of a personal thing...some people are more sensitive to the sound than others. I guess the good news is your hearing is probably pretty good. The problem may go away as the rubber gets softer. Saying you won't buy another MB is pointless, they don't care....money given back is money out of their pocket, the future is a crap shoot. You might buy another one and might not, they don't care - they'll take the loss but somewhere there is an Audi buyer with a transmission that failed that will buy an MB next time....and on it goes............

I think that I mentioned this before, but that governor had a horrible track record with respect to his appointees getting elected. One of his appointees who did win is a friend and he barely won- mainly due to his name recognition. Another of the gov's ""success stories"" is the Northern Kentucky judge who is now in hot water for allegedly having sex with coworkers in her chambers, along with drinking beer and Fireball Whiskey on the job...

This was OPI....Our Personal Opinion, but when we were looking for a 3 year old car for Florida it was between a BMW 328 and a Mercedes C 250. It was just our thinking....may be very wrong, there was more of a chance the MB was driven more carefully by a more mature person, and the BMW COULD have been driven by a younger more aggressive individual. Just our informal perceptions.
An old guy with a carefully driven S4............sounds like a stretch.
I think your perceptions are valid...to an extent. The rental industry is an exaggerated version of the real world. There are a few types (usually boring) that I might buy but I would never buy a sports or performance ex rental. The drivers of those cars tend to be young and wild.

Craig...I've had the same experiences with RainX. Never could get it to work the way it's advertised, even after applying it by strictly following the manufacturer's instructions. My Acura wipers worked as well after 3.5 years as they did when new...great longevity. No streaks, no noise.

The problem with salesman though is how they are paid. If one company is offering a higher percentage commission than the other, guess who's brand gets promoted (rather than true sound quality).

There is a big difference in interest Paid on a $100,000 loan at 4.5% vs 2.5%. Even if you are working to pay it off early.
Based on the price of the average home and going by a 30 year fixed mortgage few people will have a $100k balance with 4 years to go. Your average home owner in that situation should have a much smaller balance. Add to that that few people can cut their interest rate almost by half and add any costs associated with refinancing and the savings can be reduced significantly.

2796,Aug-13,stickguy,"Got all the paperwork to sign to get the process moving. Interesting, it is all online now. Esign the docs, and upload all my info (pay stubs, etc.). Very easy.

0 fee Refi (with the exception of a $245 recording fee, not sure why that one was not covered but will find out at some point). So closing cost is that, and escrow/prepaid property taxes/a few days interest charge. Nothing you can do about those. So it is as close to a sign and drive as you can get.

Interest rate gets bumped 1/4 point to cover the fees. So the rate we are locked at is 2.625 on a 10 year mortgage. Replaces the last 22 years of a 10/1 arm currently @ 3.25%. That loan would have started adjusting in June 2022.

Goal is to pay off the balance early, but we weren't getting it done in 22 months! Now, saving interest immediately, and for however long we end up paying (making some extra principal payments along the way) I don't have to worry about rates going up. And at that interest rate, no huge incentive to even bother doing it early.

I've often said, and am sure I've mentioned it before here, and I'll go ahead and write/say it again:

The boys are separated from the men, and the pretenders (quasi sporty cars) are separated from the truly serious sports vehicles by the tire sizing, setup, and selection.

For example, a base model prior generation S4 came with 245 tires, the larger wheel option being 255 section.
My '06 A3 from 15 years ago came with 225's as a stock tire, and XL (extra load) and Y speed rated.

If your larger than a compact ""sports sedan"" from 2010 on doesn't even have 245's..... well.... you can figure out which category you are in (staggered tire setups excepted; of course, the larger tire will often be above these thresholds).
What truly separates the men from the pretenders is not the equipment. Often have the right equipment is a function of enough funds and the intelligence of whom to ask. What separates the two is their technical skills on the track. I'll take someone with a marginally track worthy car and exceptional technical skills over someone with an exceptional trackcar who learned to drive by watching the fast and the furious movies.

Got all the paperwork to sign to get the process moving. Interesting, it is all online now. Esign the docs, and upload all my info (pay stubs, etc.). Very easy.

0 fee Refi (with the exception of a $245 recording fee, not sure why that one was not covered but will find out at some point). So closing cost is that, and escrow/prepaid property taxes/a few days interest charge. Nothing you can do about those. So it is as close to a sign and drive as you can get.

Interest rate gets bumped 1/4 point to cover the fees. So the rate we are locked at is 2.625 on a 10 year mortgage. Replaces the last 22 years of a 10/1 arm currently @ 3.25%. That loan would have started adjusting in June 2022.

Goal is to pay off the balance early, but we weren't getting it done in 22 months! Now, saving interest immediately, and for however long we end up paying (making some extra principal payments along the way) I don't have to worry about rates going up. And at that interest rate, no huge incentive to even bother doing it early.

seemed like a no brainer move. Hopefully all goes as planned (no guarantee these days).
I’ve got to refi and probably at the same time get rid of the HELOC. I’m at 15 years left so would try and go to 10

Of course the wife is talking about moving again, so there’s that too.

I pay a $125-$150 electric bill every month; that covers everything except for water- which I sometimes need to order if we don’t get enough rain.
When our house was built in 1974 there were no nearby homes or businesses and our power line runs almost directly to a substation. As long as the line to our house is up we usually don’t lose power for more than 6-8 hours tops.

Our house has always been pretty efficient. Even new in 1998, the gas furnace was a 94+ efficiency model.

When we put in the new system (2017?), the bills went down a little.. but, the more efficient A/C and variable speed blower on the new 98+ gas furnace help us keep a more even temperature, and more comfortable.

Water is about $90/quarterly (more in the summer when I use the sprinklers).
Sanitation is around $40/mo. Seems like a lot, but I'd hate to have to get rid of that stuff on my own.

I’ll echo @qbrozen’s comments about solar. We are on our 3rd year with it. Although we went a different route and leased our solar panels for 20 years from Tesla (formerly Solar City). It costs us (year 3) $109/month to lease the panels plus we still have to pay the Eversource. Last month’s bill was $148 (plus $109) and that was with running the A/C 24/7 for the entire month. April, May, & June my bill from Eversource was less than $10 (plus the $109). Our cost to lease the solar panels goes up 2.9% per year.

This storm caught Eversource off guard. It’s going to cost them a lot of money to clean up. The money doesn’t come out of their pocket, they’ll request a rate increase (of a lot more than 2.9%) and will get it.

The rest is for sewage and treatment thereof which through some clever sleight of hand the city managed to make the responsibility of the water utility a few years ago, without any commensurate reduction on their tax bills. They even shifted the responsibility for storm sewers to them, and they then came up with a cockamamie rate schedule that is based on their estimate of the size of hard surfaces (roofs, asphalt driveways, etc) on your property. Even areas without storm sewers in the ground pay this, supposedly for ditch and culvert maintenance. It has been hugely controversial.

Municipal taxes cover police, fire, garbage pickup, snow removal, street maintenance, and all the wasteful projects they like to do. The rate is $1.25 per $100 of property assessment. I pay about $200/month and don't feel like I get good value for that.

No Balloon Payment. No Final Bill. I could re-lease or have them put whatever newer technology they have available or just have them come and remove the solar panels.

If I sell my house, I have to get the people whom I sell to on board. Worst case scenario is I'd have to pay $500 or $600 to have them removed/disconnected. I don't plan on selling anytime soon. While we could definitely use the 4th bedroom & could get good money for our house (due to the mass exodus from NYC), it will cost me significantly more for that extra bedroom, then I'd have to start renovating to our taste.

Plus we have our medical paid, and lots of room in the hospitals these days. And, we would have to isolate for 14 days when we got back. If this is under control would still like to go in February or even March. The C250 may have to go 2 years between oil changes, and the STABIL will have to stay good for 2 years too.
Or you could send me the keys and I’ll spend the winter there keeping your car exercised 💪 and ensuring that the beds don’t have bugs.🐜

A friend refers to my driveway as a personal rally stage. I used to really hammer it in the corners, but I recently spent a chunk of money hauling in a couple of truckloads of gravel and having it graded- so it now has a 15 mph speed limit.

I just received a letter from Kia corporate concerning oil change intervals. They say that even though 7500 miles is the recommended OCI, many owners are driving “Severe Usage Conditions”. They consider severe usage as driving in the cold, short trips, going up hills and driving in dusty conditions. They then go on to say that severe usage is now typical for “many and perhaps most American drivers”.

They imply that because of this you should change oil at 3750 miles instead of 7500. They go on to mention keeping an eye out for excessive oil consumption. Of course they suggest you visit the Kia dealer to get all your service done.

This got me thinking of oil burning in Chrysler’s Tigershark engine which is a derivative of the World Engine that appears in many Hyundai/Kia and Mitsu cars. While Chrysler’s Tigershark is a further advancement of the WE, all these engines must share some common traits. Could oil burning be one of them?

I find it more than coincidence that I got this letter just at this time. Could this be Kia trying to get ahead of potential consumer complaints by saying people didn’t perform proper maintenance if they didn’t change oil at 3750 miles?

I change mine at 5000 with full synthetic. I’m assuming that would be as good as convention oil at 3750.

A few months after having my new front speakers installed in the Prelude the power window/lock switches would periodically stop working and the sound cut in and out. Turns out the wiring in the doors was so brittle from age trying to patch it would have been futile so I kept the harnesses but replaced the wiring.

Don't know how big your house is or the amenities, but the online place I got mine from has a 7.5Kw unit with 50A ATS for just $2k. https://www.nationwidegenerators.com/generac-powerpact-7-5kw-home-standby-generator-50-amp-8-circuit-ats-6998-w-e-stop/

Seems like a great deal. I couldn't speak to install costs. I know they want A LOT. Quotes are usually $5k and up all in. I spent $3300 on my Briggs and Stratton 12kw unit with 200A ATS and installed it myself. Even my 12kw requires I shut off the pool during power outage and be careful not to run the electric oven while any of the central AC units is running. But I shut off the pool panel, turn off the compressor in the garage, and turn off the downstairs AC and we seem to be just fine. During the recent 4-day outage, I avoided steady running for anything more than 12 hrs, with at least 1 hr breaks thrown in, usually longer. Some people never shut theirs off during long outages, but I believe that is a bad idea. I found mine needed a half qt of oil after day 2, so I'm very glad I did what I did.

2887,Aug-11,qbrozen,"Since we've talked solar here on occasion, I figure I'll share today's calculation.

So far, having just passed the 4-yr anniversary of having solar in our current home, it has earned 71 SRECs, at about $240 ea, for a total of $17k. It has also saved us $8,963 in electricity. So about $26k total. That is nearly half the system cost ($55k) in just 4 yrs. So figure year 8-9 is the breakeven. I guessed 7-8 yrs originally. Or I should say I calculated 7-8 yrs. Electricity seems to be cheaper right now than in the past. Less than 13 cents per Kwh. I used 15 cents in my original calculation. In any case, certainly a worthwhile investment.

Normally I would blow these kind of letters off as just a way to get you into the dealer but when they mentioned future oil burning it got me thinking. There have been a lot of engine designs that in retrospect would have lasted a lot longer with short OCI. The Chrysler 2.7L comes to mind. With OCD 3k oil changes they could last a lot longer.

I called Kia customer service to ask what type of oil they were talking about for the shorter change intervals and the clueless rep said “both”. He seemed to have no idea what I was talking about even though I read the letter to him over the phone.

He probably rides a bicycle.

I think about this from time to time as well. When I had the new electrical service put in a few years ago they asked me if I wanted them to install a transfer panel at the same time.

I thought you went to Florida when the weather went upside down. As for losing fridge and freezer items, you can replace dozens of those failures for what you’d pay for a backup power system.

I thought you went to Florida when the weather went upside down. As for losing fridge and freezer items, you can replace dozens of those failures for what you’d pay for a backup power system. We don’t lose power very often and when we do it’s never been a problem in my hood. So, it’s going to have to be a cold day in Hawaii before I’d think twice about a backup power system.

I doubt if we will be going to Florida this winter. But, actually being in Florida could be more of a reason to buy a generator....if the power was off for days things in the fridge/freezer could could spoil and go really bad. The power did go off for 4 days about 5 years ago......up until then I came home around New Years....but now Mrs D comes back....won't get me coming back. We had to sleep in jackets, and had to go to a restaurant for dinner and a coffee (I was ready to pay $20 for a coffee)....one more night and I would have tried to find a hotel...I couldn't wait another day.

Since we've talked solar here on occasion, I figure I'll share today's calculation.

So far, having just passed the 4-yr anniversary of having solar in our current home, it has earned 71 SRECs, at about $240 ea, for a total of $17k. It has also saved us $8,963 in electricity. So about $26k total. That is nearly half the system cost ($55k) in just 4 yrs. So figure year 8-9 is the breakeven. I guessed 7-8 yrs originally. Or I should say I calculated 7-8 yrs. Electricity seems to be cheaper right now than in the past. Less than 13 cents per Kwh. I used 15 cents in my original calculation. In any case, certainly a worthwhile investment.
So you bought your system? Is there interest costs to add to that 55K or did you already do that?

Although we went a different route and leased our solar panels for 20 years from Tesla (formerly Solar City). It costs us (year 3) $109/month to lease the panels plus we still have to pay the Eversource. Last month’s bill was $148 (plus $109) and that was with running the A/C 24/7 for the entire month. April, May, & June my bill from Eversource was less than $10 (plus the $109). Our cost to lease the solar panels goes up 2.9% per year.

This storm caught Eversource off guard. It’s going to cost them a lot of money to clean up. The money doesn’t come out of their pocket, they’ll request a rate increase (of a lot more than 2.9%) and will get it.

Today I was at a big home improvement store that is just down the street from a Mazda dealer, who was closed. I decided to go take a look at the CX-30 since I hadn’t seen one.

I must be allergic to Mazdas because I had a hard time telling the various SUVs apart from each other. They all look pretty much alike. Plus at this dealer they only had about 4 colours available, about half of them red. Now the Mazda red is a nice color but it is on so many of their models it gets a bit tired. They have a dark blue that is so dark it reads as black, a color called Titanium Flash that looked like one of their famous non-colours, not really gray, not really green or brown, sort of a metallic mud. Then white of course. That was it. I was surprised to find one with what they called a white leather interior. But it was just the seats that were white. Door cards were all black, as was the dash and other interior pieces, without even a hint of the seat color anywhere else. Looked wrong.

The other thing that I found odd was the front end. The leading edge of the hood projects forward over the grille like a knife-edged brow. The forward edge was drawn so sharp that I wondered how it passed whatever pedestrian safety regulations that exist, and it seemed a prime spot for paint chips or dents from road debris and possible rust. Overall it just left me cold.
I like how you use both the Canadian and American spelling of colour/color in your post. You are a true internationalist.

Thinking back I can’t recall ever driving a Mazda with any interior other than black. I always liked the red color paint they had but it sounds like they’re getting fancy with colors so dark they look black.

The CX-30 always seemed too small to me. The CX-5 was better. Mazda has always been criticized for being on the small size compared to competitors.

Yeah your not going to save a whole lot in interest in the last 4 or 5 years of a mortgage if you refinance. You can drop your payments by a lot by refinancing and extending the term of the loan, but it would result in paying more in the end.

That must have been an iPad autocorrect to use the Canadian version, since I never spell the word that way myself.

I found my reaction to the CX-30 unusual. I often find something to like in vehicles that interest me enough to go look at them. This one... nothing. Even the black plastic cladding on the exterior, which just about all SUVs have, seemed to look ""off"" on this one somehow. In contrast, just down the street I pulled into a Toyota dealer lot to see if they had any Corolla hatches in inventory to look at (they had just one, with a black interior of course, so zero interest) and I noticed a 2019 Fusion with just over 15K miles in a color I hadn't seen one in previously. When I walked up to it I realized the interior was also in a color I hadn't seen on one previously, and that it was a hybrid model. This had to have been a special order car. I liked it immediately and if I was in the market I would have had to go back and check it out when they were open for business.

My college girlfriend(the Beautiful Bipolar Redhead) could turn on the tears in a nanosecond.
I’ve seen that. Had one park herself outside my college dorm room door and refuse to move unless I came out to talk to her. I did....just to get her out of my dorm. Didn’t work. Plus, it cost money to block phone calls from individuals back then, so it cost me money by trying to “soothe the hurt feelings” because of her incessant phone calls. She was finally banned from entering my dorm.


Best not to get into a protracted “whose fault is it” discussion, too. Those lead to the tears, even if you entirely take the blame. Easy enough to state (in person, for @driver100 suggestion )...”this isn’t working out. It’s time for both of us to move on. I wish you the best, but please don’t contact me anymore. Best of luck!” Tears start. Don’t look back and just walk away. She’ll talk terribly about you for quite some time (usually to your closest friends). But, if you’re not together, her opinion doesn’t matter.

Do it at a neutral sight...not at your place. You are then going to have to “kick her out” which just exacerbates an already tense situation.

Looking back, I’m hoping that these experiences are more a function of my longevity and not of my “jerkiness”. Maybe a little of both!

usually it is either your blades are shot (old/hard/ripped) or, more common, the windshield is dirty with grit, etc. keeping it from being smooth. If the wipers are in good shape, best bet is to scrub down the windshield well (maybe use Bon Ami and 0000 steel wool) to get the glass and clean and smooth as possible. I also use the cleaner and scrubber to scrub down the wiper blades. then wash thoroughly, and clean with good glass cleaner.

if all that doesn't do it, replace the blades. And if it still chatters, then you are Mike.

agreed about not using them without enough water on the window. that is not good.

That must have been an iPad autocorrect to use the Canadian version, since I never spell the word that way myself.

I found my reaction to the CX-30 unusual. I often find something to like in vehicles that interest me enough to go look at them. This one... nothing. Even the black plastic cladding on the exterior, which just about all SUVs have, seemed to look ""off"" on this one somehow. In contrast, just down the street I pulled into a Toyota dealer lot to see if they had any Corolla hatches in inventory to look at (they had just one, with a black interior of course, so zero interest) and I noticed a 2019 Fusion with just over 15K miles in a color I hadn't seen one in previously. When I walked up to it I realized the interior was also in a color I hadn't seen on one previously, and that it was a hybrid model. This had to have been a special order car. I liked it immediately and if I was in the market I would have had to go back and check it out when they were open for business.





I’ve driven a few Fusions in titanium trim and don’t ever remember an interior like that. You’re right it must be a special order.

I don’t care for the exterior but if you like it you might get a good deal seeing that 2020 is the last year.

I’ve seen that. Had one park herself outside my college dorm room door and refuse to move unless I came out to talk to her. I did....just to get her out of my dorm. Didn’t work. Plus, it cost money to block phone calls from individuals back then, so it cost me money by trying to “soothe the hurt feelings” because of her incessant phone calls. She was finally banned from entering my dorm.


Best not to get into a protracted “whose fault is it” discussion, too. Those lead to the tears, even if you entirely take the blame. Easy enough to state (in person, for @driver100 suggestion )...”this isn’t working out. It’s time for both of us to move on. I wish you the best, but please don’t contact me anymore. Best of luck!” Tears start. Don’t look back and just walk away. She’ll talk terribly about you for quite some time (usually to your closest friends). But, if you’re not together, her opinion doesn’t matter.

Do it at a neutral sight...not at your place. You are then going to have to “kick her out” which just exacerbates an already tense situation.

Looking back, I’m hoping that these experiences are more a function of my longevity and not of my “jerkiness”. Maybe a little of both!

I think so. Stick, you might want to take a look at a recent statement to see how much interest you are actually paying now. You’d probably pay more interest per month on a new loan with a far lower rate just because of how mortgages work.

2974,Aug-08,stickguy,"I am going to pay it off early anyway. The bank offers no fee refis, so the principal balance will be the same and no out of pocket. They just mark up the interest rate. So as long as that is lower than my current rate (it will be, by nearly a point) I have to save money. The main reason though is that the current loan is an ARM and I won't have it paid off before the rate resets the first time most likely, and at that point, the rate can jump significantly. Even on a smaller balance (well, small relative to some mortgages) that can make a big difference.

I would not do it if I had to pay a lot of closing costs out of pocket or rolled into the balance of the new loan. But as long as I am dropping the rate with the same amount owed, and locking that in for as long as it takes, I come out ahead on the deal. But not a big issue if it does not end up happeneing.

If you have a no closing cost Re-Fi it could be worth it.

Last time we refinanced about 7 years ago, you had to borrow at least $100K, or they weren't interested in doing it.

We paid off our $41K balance mortgage in January. Four years early. The saving from not paying income tax on the earnings from the $41K cash was about as much as the saving on interest paid, for the rest of the loan. Altogether, our total savings will be about $1000, between tax avoidance and interest. Not much for four years.

How much are the closing costs? Any points? Seems to be more trouble than it's worth if you plan to pay it off in 4-5 years.

I will do it early in the morning before the sunlight covers my car.

I am expecting to hear from Mercedes on Monday or Tuesday regarding my case to replace the windshield or even to find a solution to the problem. According to the case manager, she has not experienced a complaint from a Mercedes customer about windshield wipers chattering. I don't know if she is saying that to make me feel estranged or apart from other complaints or if she really means it. Obviously they are not going to share with me the fact that this is a common complaint among Mercedes owners.

If the RainX solves the problem, which I sincerely doubt, I will drop the complaint.

Once this came up things moved quickly and like the last time there was one counter offer and we were done. Some dealers are treating the A-Specs like their dipped in gold but it was seamless and my dealer pretty much earned my loyalty until they do something that breaks that trust. Excuse the front plate frame, that comes off next week. Early impressions are that we're going to really enjoy it and the touchpad isn't as steep a learning curve as originally thought.

Kia has started putting Michelin Primacy tires on some Stingers instead of Pilot Sports. So in addition to a reduced handling capability the top speed is reduced as well.
Meh.
handling feel could make a difference, if a specific driver notices at the margins (and it bothers them) but I really doubt that dropping the top speed limiter from 149 to something like 130 is going to make 1 iota of difference. Not like they limited to 65 or something. It is still way faster than anyone will ever drive the car.

3017,Aug-09,ab348,"Today I was at a big home improvement store that is just down the street from a Mazda dealer, who was closed. I decided to go take a look at the CX-30 since I hadn’t seen one.

I must be allergic to Mazdas because I had a hard time telling the various SUVs apart from each other. They all look pretty much alike. Plus at this dealer they only had about 4 colours available, about half of them red. Now the Mazda red is a nice color but it is on so many of their models it gets a bit tired. They have a dark blue that is so dark it reads as black, a color called Titanium Flash that looked like one of their famous non-colours, not really gray, not really green or brown, sort of a metallic mud. Then white of course. That was it. I was surprised to find one with what they called a white leather interior. But it was just the seats that were white. Door cards were all black, as was the dash and other interior pieces, without even a hint of the seat color anywhere else. Looked wrong.

The other thing that I found odd was the front end. The leading edge of the hood projects forward over the grille like a knife-edged brow. The forward edge was drawn so sharp that I wondered how it passed whatever pedestrian safety regulations that exist, and it seemed a prime spot for paint chips or dents from road debris and possible rust. Overall it just left me cold.

Mentioned it was time to get the Stinger’s oil changed. Given the dealer threw in 6 services to make up for their insistence on charging a doc fee when I bought it at the first of the year, it was “on the house”.

Anyway, nothing untoward happened. I got used to being catered to with my Acura. No loaner Kia offered. It took 90 minutes. They did the oil change, the tire rotation the numerous and sundry eyeball checks of everything else. Cost? $0! Still, it took 90 minutes. Forgot how time consuming dealer service can be. They have all the tools, they have lifts, they have everything they need. Yet, it took them 3x the amount of time it should have. And, I even made an appointment.

Good news is the service area was super clean. Their free coffee was actually quite good. They had cookies and chips for the taking. There was free WiFi. They practiced “no touch” customer interfacing. Everything was done via texts and emails on my iPhone. They asked if I wanted a free car wash, which I declined given it was one of those brush automated machines.

Long and short of it, I was happy with the service experience. They were polite. They did what they said they were going to do. Their service area was pleasant and comfortable.

They said they were still offering no charge pick up and drop off service on cars still under warranty (which would be a lot of cars given their lengthy warranty). Probably should have done that.

Still, went off without a hitch. Given the stories about Kia, I’m pleasantly surprised.
If I was 100% sure that the Louisville dealers would provide competent service I’d be much more inclined to consider a Stinger. I have to admit that I’m spoiled by my BMW dealer- by their quality of service as well as their loaner policy.

I am a poor Canadian in that I pay very little attention to the NHL, think the Canadian Football League is a bad joke, root against the Blue Jays, and do not like square-head fasteners. While they do seem to allow more twisting force, that is dependent upon a perfect driving bit, a perfectly perpendicular position of the tool, and a perfectly-formed screw head. Any deviation from any of those can result in a spinning bit which deforms itself and then becomes unusable in the future.

How is it more of a gimmick than a gapping tool? I have seen pros use them.
Because a plug gaping tool has a specific piece of calibrated wire to set the gap. Therefore, you have the best chance of setting the gap correctly. Using that sliding thingy you have almost no chance of getting the gap set as accurately as you can with the calibrated wire. Now, do you have to be that precise when setting spark plug gaps, probably not. However, I like to have the right tool for the job I’m doing which is why I have as many tools collecting dust hanging on the pegboard in my garage. FWIW, you could use a flat blade screw driver to set the spark plug gap instead of that thingy you use. Afterall, it tapers up as you go from the tip toward the handle.

To be honest, I’ve never climbed into a mechanics tool box but IF I saw one of those gimmick thingies in there I’d be a little uneasy having him work on my car.

The first two months were increditably good, then the da**n thing sagged, but...not enough to meet the return guarantee. It became more and more uncomfortable until we could no longer tolerate it after 2 and a half years. The “premium” mattress was a POS, a big mistake! Mind you, nether of us are heavy people. I spoke to friends and colleagues and many epseemed to like the cheaper bed in a box type of mattress, like “Tuft ‘n Needle”. Off we went to a store (not Mattress Firm, who I swear sell defects, and are currently in financial trouble). We ended up really liking “Purple 2”, a hybrid with cooling foam on top, medium firmness. After two years, we still like it and it’s holding up well - no sag and cool. With our short mattress longevity, cheaper was better. We liked the newest generation TempurPedic, so I hope @abacomike is happy with his - just too pricey with our track record.

I should mention that the Stearns mattress and box spring from Mattress Firm was the third - the first replaced cause of a grease spot on it, the second replaced because it sagged after two mos. This was a fore-warning of what was to come and our experience with Mattress Firm."

Unless the company says a different windshield, which I believe someone said has a special coating on the glass, would solve the problem, I'd rather keep the original windshield glued to the car. It's an integral part of the structure.

I think there's something about the rubber in the wiper blades, or the various leverages in the linkages used to control that that's allowing easy jerking as the blades ""catch"" and release. There's something wrong.

Neither of cars has the problem. I had seen it in past cars but only when the windshield was coated with road grit and oils. Cleaning the blades with isopropyl alcohol and the windshield with Dawn and steel wood fixed it.

I've said before that rubbing the windshield with Barkeepers Friend which contains very fine oxalic acid IIRC or cleaning my windshield with 00 or finer steel wool and water and detergent will remove that grit and oil, just like clay bar rubbing paint with detergent water will take off grit to prep for waxing.

What I can't believe is that Fintail says this has been a problem with some years of history for MB, yet MB hasn't fixed it.

Have any other brands had this with their windshield and wipers?

I agree that it looks like a spark plug gap tool if you look at it quickly but like you said, a plug gap tool had different size wires not flat blades.

It had as engraving of a C-130 on it with Lockheed’s name and the planes S/N. I promptly broke the small blade trying to remove a small philips head screw on one of our other planes because I was too lazy to go to the shop to get my tool box. When the rep heard I broke the tool he wanted to give me another one but I thanked him for the offer and told him, “I’m going to keep this tool on my key ring as a reminder of what happens when you’re too lazy to use the right tool for the job”. He just smiled and walked away.

I kept that tool on my key ring until just a few years ago. Finally decided I didn’t want to lose it so it now sits in my drawer on an old key ring...it did it’s job.

From my research, it depends on the firmness of the mattress. My old mattress was too firm which caused me pain. This new one seems to have a little give to it - it's a medium - I tried the firm and it was too hard on my back.

When I sleep, I am on my sides but usually end up on my back. So I raise my head and legs to ease pressure on my back.

3111,Aug-06,graphicguy,"Mentioned it was time to get the Stinger’s oil changed. Given the dealer threw in 6 services to make up for their insistence on charging a doc fee when I bought it at the first of the year, it was “on the house”.

Anyway, nothing untoward happened. I got used to being catered to with my Acura. No loaner Kia offered. It took 90 minutes. They did the oil change, the tire rotation the numerous and sundry eyeball checks of everything else. Cost? $0! Still, it took 90 minutes. Forgot how time consuming dealer service can be. They have all the tools, they have lifts, they have everything they need. Yet, it took them 3x the amount of time it should have. And, I even made an appointment.

Good news is the service area was super clean. Their free coffee was actually quite good. They had cookies and chips for the taking. There was free WiFi. They practiced “no touch” customer interfacing. Everything was done via texts and emails on my iPhone. They asked if I wanted a free car wash, which I declined given it was one of those brush automated machines.

Long and short of it, I was happy with the service experience. They were polite. They did what they said they were going to do. Their service area was pleasant and comfortable.

They said they were still offering no charge pick up and drop off service on cars still under warranty (which would be a lot of cars given their lengthy warranty). Probably should have done that.

Still, went off without a hitch. Given the stories about Kia, I’m pleasantly surprised.

My spark plug gap tool has a flat blade that goes completely around the tool that increases in thickness as it goes.
I inherited a gapping tool from my father that was composed of a series of blades that increased in thickness from a few thousandths of an inch up to maybe a half inch. Thought it was an odd thing to gap plugs until I found out it was a gap tool for steam turbines which he was building at General Electric.

From my research, it depends on the firmness of the mattress. My old mattress was too firm which caused me pain. This new one seems to have a little give to it - it's a medium - I tried the firm and it was too hard on my back.

When I sleep, I am on my sides but usually end up on my back. So I raise my head and legs to ease pressure on my back.

Just less money for the kids to spend when I am gone!😜😜🤓
I know people who have those mattresses and love them, but they aren’t for me. We splurged on a high quality Regular mattress instead and it’s been great. Those cost serious $$ too!

Being in Canada a flat blade tool like that is virtually useless for driving screws. Pretty much everything here is square (Robertson) head, Occasionally you need a Philips head for imported items.

The flat blade tool might be useful for opening crown-cap bottles or prying things apart though.
So that’s what they’re called. That square design was popular down here maybe 15 years ago. Now you can’t find the drill bits to take them out.

I hear the unmistakable screaming sound of a crotch-rocket racing motorcycle heading towards my corner. I look up and see this idiot blowing through the stop sign at what was easily 50-60mph. Infuriating, this is a quiet residential street with kids on bicycles and runners that use the street since there is little traffic. He flashes past and as I see him flying up the street I also see a Ford pickup backing out of a driveway up ahead. He throws out the anchors, wiggles some, and then had just enough control to veer around the truck without dumping the bike. If he had t-boned that thing he would have been dead at the speed he was going. Damn scary.

I've had only 8 in 25 years. When I had the issue, I was pretty much told ""good luck"" after my second set of blades replaced under warranty. They did the arm tension thing, too. But that was a pre-facelift 212, which had a different blade holder design - so it could be taken apart and replaced with Bosch rubber. It worked. No such possibility on later models.

Unless they have certainty that some aspect of the windshield has changed, I wouldn't believe a replacement would help.

We have a shortage in aluminum cans, used for soft drinks and for beer. Since the bars have been closed people were buying beer and soft drinks to take home....people seem to prefer cans. They use the cans for the more popular flavors, and you can only buy bottles of less popular flavors.....like A&W diet Root Beer.
I wish I had known, I just spent an afternoon cleaning out my son’s apartment and his roommate left hundreds of cans all over the place. I could have solved your aluminum shortage easily.

Now down here we have a coin shortage so bad that one store was asking people to donate their change to the next lowest dollar to charity. My wife who likes to wrap coins is working on solving that problem by cleaning out all our car cup holders.

I remember a movie where the couple were driving down the Pacific Coast and in some scenes the ocean is on the right of the car and other times it is on the left.

Every time I go to SoCal, a friend of mine and I like to visit the local Fry's. It's like Best Buy and Radio Shack got together, given the number of components you can buy separately.

My own opinion:

I think most people today are looking for a more ""plug and play"" solution, which would explain the popularity of something like Sonos.

Think about the time and effort @graphicguy put into assembling and tuning his friends system - very few people have the patience to go through something like that (or, they call ""the guy"" to do it for them). Plus, with most everything being wireless now, who wants to connect all those wires and cables?

Will it result in better sound quality? I'm sure the audiophiles here would say yes, enthusiastically. Will 90% of the population know, or care? Probably not.
Good point. I think convenience rules. As you say, that has caused bluetooth speakers, all-in-one solutions for streaming, plug and go solutions, etc to really define the market.

Even 25 years ago, CD boomboxes were the ""go to"" sound solutions. So, not a recent phenomena.

However, given vinyl record resurgence, the rise of internet only audio manufacturers (Emotiva, Schitt, PSA, Hsu, Axiom, SVS, Monoprice, etc), there's a certain section of people out there who want good sound. Even boutique brands like REL, Magnepan, Martin Logan, VPI, Ohm, etc are still kicking around and doing well. Relative new comers like ELAC are doing well, also.

Most people don't even know the brands I mentioned above.

Big brands, like Bose, Sony, Onkyo, Pioneer, etc need economies of scale to continue. Ergo, the consolidation that's taking place.

Klipsch has kept their feet in both camps. They make bluetooth speakers. They make speakers you can buy at Best Buy. They've purchased other strategic brands. But, take a look at their high end products (https://www.klipsch.com/heritage-premium-audio-speakers) and you realize they've been doing this for a long time and have adapted while keeping their high end audio core in tact. Obviously, I admire them.

The vast majority wouldn't even dream of spending the kind of money I have in my Home Theater system. Not bragging about that, but it's something I enjoy and am willing to drop some coin on. I'm sure @tjc78 and @roadburner feel the same.

Now that I've been bit by the 2-channel bug (seems what goes around, comes around), I'm realizing I can get better performance given the last time I had a true stereo system.

My 29 year old Rotel RCD-855 CD player was designed in England using a Phillips of the Netherlands TDA1541A-S1 D/A chip and assembled in Hong Kong.


Philips (and Sony) were sound royalty of the CD era. Rotel has always had a great rep. I have an Oppo CDP 205. Oppo is out of that business, but the best multi-format disk player I've ever seen/heard. I actually thought about buying a couple of them before they stopped selling them to list on eBay.

would that also make it change modes, though? Meaning, I may have it set to 3-channel stereo, but then all of sudden, I find it in theatre mode, or some such thing. It likes to choose a mode that creates a fake echo. It is really annoying. Never even understood why such a mode exists.

Anyway, as you said, it probably isn't worth messing with unless I'm hellbent on not spending money. I'm now wonder what happened to my old Pioneer. I barely used it. Can't recall if I gave that away or have it in the basement somewhere.
There's a separate PCB that they probably used to control listening modes...probably part of the Digital to Analogue converter. Depending on the source, some of those were soldered by machine. If the PCB set in the jig just a little off, the solder would be askew. Given heat and time, those are usually the culprit when you have the sort of behavior you're describing. The PCBs don't fail. The solder does.

That seemed really cool then, around 1985. From there, it was a CD changer with separate speakers, worked well enough in a bedroom. Today I still have a turn of the century bookshelf system with separate speakers and a complicated CD changer mechanism that opens automatically and presents the CD cartridge - I am hosed if it breaks, but I don't use it anyway, just feel bad letting it go, as it is pristine and would probably end up in the skip.

3197,Aug-04,omarman,"In 1980 I had subscriptions to Stereo Review and High Fidelity magazines. Between the two I found the commentary provided by Julian Hirsch (including the test results of Hirsch-Houck Laboratories) made Stereo Review a more interesting read for me. And the humor I found in Stereo Review seemed to lean in the direction of D.E.D. school of irreverent commentary. Both in text and the occasional cartoons here and there.

I recall a panel cartoon in Stereo Review depicting a glowering Incredible Hulk figure crashing into the listening room of a middle aged audiophile and holding up a tiny new Philips invention called the Compact Disc as the era of vinyl was dying. Today's equivalent would be Dr. David Banner crying, ""I want my records back!""

Even now the best advice I've ever heard for recreating the most satisfying home audio experience is to match the range and capabilities of all components along with proper set up in the appropriate environment. I don't see a problem with shopping or collecting audio equipment for whatever coin when it's all about creating that music experience which can be so very satisfying to build over time.

Although as I typed that I recalled another 1 panel cartoon from an old Stereo Review issue. It depicted a guy unpacking a new turntable to add to a large rack filled with audio equipment in his music room. 2 women stood in a doorway looking at the man with the caption, ""All I can say is thank God for food stamps Harriet.""

My favorite scene in Gran Torino was the part where Walt tries to explain his impressive arsenal of tools in the garage to the kid he calls ""Toad,"" who tried to steal his car. But it takes years to put together a toolbox like Walt's so he gave the kid basic tools which every man needs to get started: a pair of vice grips, duct tape and a can of WD40. ""Any man worth his salt can do half the household chores with just those three things.""

And the same beginnings for any kid who starts out with a tuner, amp and speakers as well. That's just another toolbox collection which grows over time. I read somewhere that we collect things that we someday hope to master. Not a problem unless the drive to collect things gets in the way of enjoying that which we had hoped to master. Music, cars, car repair, whatever.

Meanwhile, also in 1980, audio advertising was still focused on a moon race to the lowest inaudible, intangible THD claims. I remember so many ads inviting consumers to ""listen to the difference"" between our clean amp power versus our competitor's trash, etc. I listened to a lot of really clean tuner/amp power back then. It wasn't that hard to find and not really that much coin unless you wanted some of the beautiful things in the glossy ads. And who didn't?

And whatever happened to the dire warnings of TIM distortion theories back then? I never hear anything about that now. But I couldn't hear it then either. See what I did there?

Interesting list of old ""boutique"" audio brands like Magnepan posted. And I'll mention Polk speakers as a very good but non-boutique brand as well. Sound United now owns Polk Audio, Definitive Technology, Boston Acoustics and also Denon and Marantz. A month ago I read that they were set to acquire B&W speakers.









A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing."
3198,Aug-04,dino001,"I think it's true that most people who in their childhood/youth played any kind of instrument, sang, or otherwise participated in any musical activity end up preferring hi fidelity sound systems, whatever they can afford. It can be a component system, or even a single unit system, but it had to be good enough within their financial means.
It's probably due to their developed discriminate musical ear. There may be others who never played or sang anything, but still have high appreciation, but it's probably not very high number. The reason would be if one has musical talents of any kind, even modest ones, they'll likely be discovered and encouraged to be developed by their parents or teachers, at least a little (children get bored quickly, as I did after two years of piano), which in turn will make them more attune with sound quality for life. Basic reinforcement.

I asked before about SiriusXM sound quality (or lack of) vs CD/DVD vs USB drive when playing the same song on my Pioneer system in the Malibu. I still felt the USB drive quality was better than the CD quality. I decided it had to be in the quality of the electronics reading the CD because both it and the USB drive were reading digital versions.
There is also file format. I would be really surprised if your USB was better than the original CD as it was sold in stores (.wav file format which is 10 times larger than lossy .mp3 format), but if you burnt both USB and CD using same compression format then it may be the sound processor (DSP) inside of the CD player sending the signal to the receiver vs. USB decoded directly by the receiver.

I think that an overwhelming majority of the public have no clue about what an accurate music or home theater sounds like. Just give them a wireless speaker with a single 5.25 driver that plays loud and they will be happy as pigs in mud.

I think it helps if you've had a ""few too many"" adult beverages. Then perhaps I won't notice that you've over driven your 90's Aiwa shelf system to high sound levels, and of course, high sound distortion to go with it. Nothing against Aiwa, they probably made some of the best mini-shelf systems, but that's not saying much.

Good point. I think convenience rules. As you say, that has caused bluetooth speakers, all-in-one solutions for streaming, plug and go solutions, etc to really define the market.

Even 25 years ago, CD boomboxes were the ""go to"" sound solutions. So, not a recent phenomena.

However, given vinyl record resurgence, the rise of internet only audio manufacturers (Emotiva, Schitt, PSA, Hsu, Axiom, SVS, Monoprice, etc), there's a certain section of people out there who want good sound. Even boutique brands like REL, Magnepan, Martin Logan, VPI, Ohm, etc are still kicking around and doing well. Relative new comers like ELAC are doing well, also.

Most people don't even know the brands I mentioned above.

Big brands, like Bose, Sony, Onkyo, Pioneer, etc need economies of scale to continue. Ergo, the consolidation that's taking place.

Klipsch has kept their feet in both camps. They make bluetooth speakers. They make speakers you can buy at Best Buy. They've purchased other strategic brands. But, take a look at their high end products (https://www.klipsch.com/heritage-premium-audio-speakers) and you realize they've been doing this for a long time and have adapted while keeping their high end audio core in tact. Obviously, I admire them.

The vast majority wouldn't even dream of spending the kind of money I have in my Home Theater system. Not bragging about that, but it's something I enjoy and am willing to drop some coin on. I'm sure @tjc78 and @roadburner feel the same.

Now that I've been bit by the 2-channel bug (seems what goes around, comes around), I'm realizing I can get better performance given the last time I had a true stereo system.

Polk Audio has managed to survive as well, having been bought out by a larger consumer electronics firm.

It's funny how things come full circle. When I was a little kid we had a record player. Mono, with one speaker. Then stereo became commonplace and we upgraded to one of the combo TV/stereo console things in the living room, which seemed high-end at the time and which today cannot be given away. Once I got out of university and got my own place I had to get a proper component stereo system, as did most of my friends/coworkers. One of my brothers was really into it as well. I remember him noting to me how you could hear, on records he was playing, the hiss when the master tape began on the record.

The return of vinyl still makes me shake my head a bit. I remember when CDs appeared how they sounded better to me than vinyl - no dust pops or scratches, consistent speed, no need to clean them, etc. Now of course we know they had some shortcomings but to most folks they just seemed far better. I think returning to vinyl is partly a nostalgia play for some, and a hipster play for others. The sound they reproduce may actually be better but most people cannot hear it because their equipment isn't sensitive enough, or their hearing can't detect it. It is a different sort of sound but whether it is always better is something I am dubious about. The large-format album art and liner notes are nice though.

Now we listen to music on iPhones and on little Bluetooth speakers and for a lot of people it sounds ""good enough"" even if it isn't good. Full circle. But it is convenient, portable, and a massive library can get carried in your pocket, or streamed from the cloud. Good enough is OK for a lot of folks given that.
My opinion is that if your equipment is good enough to take advantage of vinyl sound, then it is good enough to take advantage of digital sound. I'll say Lossless/DVD-Audio/Super Audio CD beats vinyl. But I'm not sure regular 16-bit 48Khz CD audio beats vinyl in every way. Of course, a lot depends on the quality of the recording and mastering used.

Wow. Even an extended warranty would have only been about 3 years or so? Hope the new Denon 3700H arrives as promised. Lately I've been skeptical at first but then very happy with Amazon deliveries.
I don't buy extended warranties, unless it's really inexpensive (usually isn't). I have an automatic 2-year extension on my credit card. Electronics usually works forever, at least 10 years (my 15 year plasma TV gave up couple of months ago), as long as it survives first year, all the ""burn-in"" heat cycles, the problem is usually is their rapid obsolescence, not quality issues. If you look all the pictures of these old vintage receivers people posted here - probably still in working condition, but not in use. This one was just a case of bad luck - faulty DSP chip manufacturing from Texas Instruments that became widely recognized for this vintage of Pioneer and Onkyo receivers. They even had a replacement program in place, but discontinued it end of last year, as they run out of parts. It almost would have been better if it went year sooner, but oh, well. Now I'm getting latest and greatest, which will be obsolete in couple of years, as there will undoubtedly be HDMI HDCP 17.5, 15.5.3.1 surround systems, or some other breakthrough-must-have doo-dad added.

So my Pioneer Receiver is officially dead (to be precise it's the DSP chip that's dead) so I pulled the trigger in 2020 Denon 3700H. It's weird - market is usually flush with these things, but when you go to various websites there is a lot of ""out of stock"" and as a result not whole lot of discounting for last year or two-year old relevant models (I usually don't mind getting something like open box or clearance model). So if I'm buying full sticker, I may as well get the newest model (it's got a few small tweaks over last year). It also looks it is just about to be released by Denon (they started with highest priced models first, which I think makes sense from market capture point of view), now they're going ""mid-high"", which this one is. Amazon promises end of this week, other retailers put either out of stock or have 2+ weeks waiting backorder on it. Will see if Amazon was too optimistic or plain deceitful.

I'm also getting new ELAC Dolby Atmos-compatible speakers on top of my floor column speakers for the ceiling bounce effect (in lieu of ceiling mounted speakers), will see if that works as promised.

I'm still bummed by my Pioneer's too short life. Five years was not enough for this price range. Also, its amplifier works, it's just the chip that went bad, but it makes no sense to try to repair it, considering they're out of those chips anyway.
Ditto my Denon, and I only got 4 years at best (probably slightly less if I count weeks/days). Same issue; the amp works with analog sources, it's just the digital/Hdmi board that died. Told ""don't have those parts anymore; most likely"" by Denon.

Too bad about the Pio. That's unusual. Pioneer Electronics, especially their Elite line, are very robust. Those ELACs are very sweet, though. My son has a pair of ELAC towers. They are wonderful, especially for the price.

With all the consolidation among the audio electronics manufacturers, especially those in Japan, it seems lots of SKUs are ""unavailable"". And, I'm betting big box retailers have all suspended ordering, stock levels will be low for a while.

Pioneer and Onkyo merged. Klipsch owns Jamo, Mirage, Athena and Energy speaker companies. Denon, in particular, has been scarce. They are also owned by the same company who owns Marantz.

Yeah, the consolidation is such that soon we'll have couple of companies, just like with TVs. Onkyo/ Pioneer were in talks to be acquired by Sound United (Denon, Marantz, Polk, etc.) some time earlier.

I happened to think that .mp3 file format was an an insult to anybody who could hear anything other than noise, but it took over the CDs well before it was actually worth listening after evolving into lossless compression formats like ALAC and FLAC. When those became common and my phone had enough storage to keep my library, I switched then, but not earlier. Now it's the wireless, I think it also evolved to ""good enough"". I have a pair of bluetooth headphones and they have quite impressive sound, even if that over the jack wire is still slightly better (fuller). The only thing that can be annoying is occasional malfunctions/interference that I experienced in some situations. When traditional players can't see that revolution coming, the startups like Sonos, will eat their lunch.

Actually, it's probably fixable. The potentiometer is probably dirty and the switching board sounds like the solder is breaking down. Up to you whether you feel comfortable ""tinkering"" with it. Then again, it's 22 years old.
would that also make it change modes, though? Meaning, I may have it set to 3-channel stereo, but then all of sudden, I find it in theatre mode, or some such thing. It likes to choose a mode that creates a fake echo. It is really annoying. Never even understood why such a mode exists.

Anyway, as you said, it probably isn't worth messing with unless I'm hellbent on not spending money. I'm now wonder what happened to my old Pioneer. I barely used it. Can't recall if I gave that away or have it in the basement somewhere.

We went to a wedding in St Louis and the brides family provided 3 coach buses for out of town people to travel to and from the Ritz Carlton to the rehearsal party and wedding/reception.
In line to get on the bus one time, the driver, a big guy dressed in a suit with a cowboy hat and a deep southern drawl voice stopped a guy who was about to get on the bus.
He said ""Your jacket isn't sitting right, let me fix it for you.""
The guy says ""Are you sure?""
Driver says, ""Don't worry this ain't my first rodeo"".
As the bus driver was adjusting the guy's jacket, the guy says ""Ok, but I'm the manager at Brooks Bothers in Manhattan"".
I didn't really want to walk by the driver to get on the bus after that, but I didn't attract undo attention.
Thinking back, it must have been a prank.

My own opinion:

I think most people today are looking for a more ""plug and play"" solution, which would explain the popularity of something like Sonos.

Think about the time and effort @graphicguy put into assembling and tuning his friends system - very few people have the patience to go through something like that (or, they call ""the guy"" to do it for them). Plus, with most everything being wireless now, who wants to connect all those wires and cables?

Will it result in better sound quality? I'm sure the audiophiles here would say yes, enthusiastically. Will 90% of the population know, or care? Probably not.
I think that an overwhelming majority of the public have no clue about what an accurate music or home theater sounds like. Just give them a wireless speaker with a single 5.25 driver that plays loud and they will be happy as pigs in mud.

My ears are aged past being too critical. But I recall my first week at Miami University and the student center had a listening room near the entrance where they played classical music on a system (1966) with Acoustic Research AR3a speakers. I sat and listened to those and was impressed with their true sound. Often after eating in the cafeteria, I'd stop in the room to hear what was playing.

I played clarinet in high school band and I wonder if people who played musical instruments were more attuned to whether the sound from an amplifier and speakers is true to the original performance.

I bought AR3a speakers a few years later when I built my Heathkit. Still have them.

According to Fords UK website the Mustang starts at 38,035 Pounds which at today's exchange rate works out to $49,771. Nope not cheap at all.
Yes, the video is about the Bullitt version. I think that’s $50k here.

Today I was wasting time looking at Craigslist for who knows what. I noticed a large number of Ford Fouci at dealers lots in the 14’-16’ range. Since those are in the range when Ford had those terrible dual clutch transmissions I couldn’t understand the logic of buying those at auction when they were sure to result in disappointment. Could that be a sign of the shortage of cars in the wholesale market?

I thought that a Focus with a manual might make a good knock around winter car but those are tough to find. Even when you do the prices are astounding.

This looked nice until I ran it through TMV and it came out $2000 overpriced.

We have a neighbor who has a Tesla powerwall and solar panels. The solar panels run his home during the day and excess power charges the powerwall and the powerwall powers the house at night. Not sure what it cost him but he is all but off the grid. He likes it.

However given the price I would look at a gas generator.
Battery backup is about the least cost effective solution. When I had my panels installed, they quoted me $5k for the battery backup. IIRC, the estimate was that it could provide up to 5 hrs of power. My NG generator cost me $3500 and offers an indefinite power supply. Maybe it makes more sense if you have never experienced a long-term power outage AND you live where you don’t get credit for the excess power your solar feeds into the grid. Neither of those is true for me.

In this situation the batteries are not a backup so to speak, they store any excess power for the night or times when there is not enough light to produce enough all the power needs of the house.

Once the powerwall is fully charged any excess power generated gets sent onto the grid for credit.

In this situation the batteries are not a backup so to speak, they store any excess power for the night or times when there is not enough light to produce enough all the power needs of the house.

Once the powerwall is fully charged any excess power generated gets sent onto the grid for credit.
If they get credit, than what is the point? If you pull energy from the batteries or from the grid, it is costing you the same. But they’ve added the expense of the batteries, so it is ultimately far more expensive.

To get info on hurricanes and storms, I try to tune in to local weather reports on local TV channels. They report ""facts"" and ""data"" only!

Occasionally I tune to the Weather Channel for updates - and I get inundated with sensationalism and Shakespearean Drama. Sure they provide weather data and storm positioning, but they over dramatize the information.

As an example, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and they reported that fact as the NWS updated info, but then they warn of impending strengthening and to stay tuned for up-to-the-minute reports from meteorologists on Ft. Lauderdale Beach, Vero Beach, Daytona Beach, etc. ""...I am very concerned about this storm causing extensive damage and power outages..."" says the chief hurricane specialist.

I realize that they are providing a service to the public during these storm developments but there's a troubling ""slant"" in my opinion when compared to local weather reporting which tends to be less dramatic and less ominous.

This is just my opinion.😜🤪🤓
Trusted, LOCAL sources are where it's at! If you're in the big city, your local media will tell you whether you need to be scared or not. (TWC wants the rest of the nation to believe there will be havoc in the biggest city possible.) If you're in a smaller city, your local media won't forget about you!

So if I'm buying full sticker, I may as well get the newest model (it's got a few small tweaks over last year). It also looks it is just about to be released by Denon (they started with highest priced models first, which I think makes sense from market capture point of view), now they're going ""mid-high"", which this one is. Amazon promises end of this week, other retailers put either out of stock or have 2+ weeks waiting backorder on it. Will see if Amazon was too optimistic or plain deceitful.

I'm also getting new ELAC Dolby Atmos-compatible speakers on top of my floor column speakers for the ceiling bounce effect (in lieu of ceiling mounted speakers), will see if that works as promised.

I'm still bummed by my Pioneer's too short life. Five years was not enough for this price range. Also, its amplifier works, it's just the chip that went bad, but it makes no sense to try to repair it, considering they're out of those chips anyway.

Thinking of power supplies, I've considered recommending son and DIL check into backup power for their new home. I've seen stories about larger batteries as backups rather than natural gas or gasoline powered generators.

Does anyone have any experience with either one? I've also considered buying them a fairly large backup power supply for their computers since they both are heavy uses and work from home much of the time.
We have a neighbor who has a Tesla powerwall and solar panels. The solar panels run his home during the day and excess power charges the powerwall and the powerwall powers the house at night. Not sure what it cost him but he is all but off the grid. He likes it.

However given the price I would look at a gas generator.

Thanks for your concern, imid. I did not experience a power outage, that I know of. Storm is 45 miles due east of me moving up into Palm Beach County. My daughter lives in South Boynton Beach, near the ocean, but she tells me everything is OK.

Very foggy outside with occasional heavy squalls from the bands of the storm. When the storm crossed Andros Island (largest Bahamian Island), it fizzled to a tropical storm with winds at 65-70 mph. It has not recovered from that and remains a tropical storm. The winds move counterclockwise around the center so our winds will be coming in from the west northwest soon.

I guess we dodged another bullet on this one like we did with Dorian last summer.

3368,Aug-02,abacomike,"To get info on hurricanes and storms, I try to tune in to local weather reports on local TV channels. They report ""facts"" and ""data"" only!

Occasionally I tune to the Weather Channel for updates - and I get inundated with sensationalism and Shakespearean Drama. Sure they provide weather data and storm positioning, but they over dramatize the information.

As an example, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and they reported that fact as the NWS updated info, but then they warn of impending strengthening and to stay tuned for up-to-the-minute reports from meteorologists on Ft. Lauderdale Beach, Vero Beach, Daytona Beach, etc. ""...I am very concerned about this storm causing extensive damage and power outages..."" says the chief hurricane specialist.

I realize that they are providing a service to the public during these storm developments but there's a troubling ""slant"" in my opinion when compared to local weather reporting which tends to be less dramatic and less ominous.

lease a service loaner. Might help a bit.
Yes, a little. Equipped the way we would want, a T6 Momentum with HK and heated rear seats is 60K. No way that’s leasing at $500/ month. It’s more like $650ish. An Inscription is upper 60s and payments in the 7’s right now.

Remind me again why you need to fill the bathtub? I could understand if you were on a well, but don't you have municipal water?
Yes, we have municipal water, but no water towers. Everything operates on pumps. We have 2 pumps for our building. If electricity goes down, pumps shut down. Same for the water from the city - everything is on pumps.

I think most municipal water systems are gravity pressurized from a storage tank sitting on a high point but the tank has to be kept full by water being constantly pumped up to the tanks. If the pump goes out the storage eventually goes dry.

The other possibility is that in flat places like Florida, individual buildings must have electric pumps to pressurize their pipes to the upper floors which may be higher than the municipal storage tanks. Power goes out so do the pumps.

I suspected as much. Over in the St. Petersburg area I only saw one actual water tower in Seminole where there is small ridge. At one point on Park Blvd. there is what I assume is a large water main that comes up out of the ground and crosses an intersection at a height of about 15’. They have traffic lights mounted on it. They must need pumps to move water up and over a road.

You never think of the challenges of doing utilities where there is a high water table.

C’mon man, be honest. You were checking adds to see how bad you screwed up.

3430,Jul-30,imidazol97,"I was quick to comment when I had to phone SiriusXM to try to renew my 5 month trial combo and got various selling and stalling strategies before I was able to renew at the $5/mo with Travelink added.

I called last week. I had seen ads for 12 months at $5 per month in missives about the XM in my son's Cruze. He doesn't want it so it was never renewed. When I logged onto the computer earlier to see what came up from the email I got about my car, the 12/5 was offered. When I called, it was offered on the phone call with an automated renewal for that rate for Select plan.

When I got to the live person and said I wanted the 12 for 5 but I wanted to add Travelink--did they have a plan for it along with the 12 months. He said ""Great."" When he had started he said he wasn't going to waste my time. An interesting comment that they intended to quickly try to please the caller with a plan rather than diddle with various offers.

A few minutes later I now have the 12 month plan some posters here had gotten AND I have my silly ability to push a button and see the gas station prices nearby on the screen. The phone I have doesn't show gas buddy very well (Daytongasprices.com). The prices always are tiny and reading them while driving is dangerous.

Still not available to have notices. He checked again. Entered my DL number and he commented there was a different ID showing on the screen where he had to go to do this somewhere in the depths of the building... He deleted that.

Something got criss-crossed with my account. The system had decided my box was a business box rather than for personal use and therefore doesn't deserve informed delivery notices to my email.

I should have been better in my description. I first struck up a conversation with one of the dealers. He had a brick and mortar store nearby, which is where I heard his Klipsch.

He threw out a number which I wasn’t interested. He wants to check how much he has in his speakers, which he said he didn’t know off the top of his head.

He could probably make $200-$250 on my speakers. Not sure he’s interested in having speakers he can only make a couple hundred dollars on.
I spent a lot of time looking for speakers when I set up my first decent system in 1990; I finally listened to the Klipsch KG4 at a mom-and-pop store in Louisville.

I think most municipal water systems are gravity pressurized from a storage tank sitting on a high point but the tank has to be kept full by water being constantly pumped up to the tanks. If the pump goes out the storage eventually goes dry.

The other possibility is that in flat places like Florida, individual buildings must have electric pumps to pressurize their pipes to the upper floors which may be higher than the municipal storage tanks. Power goes out so do the pumps.

What I noticed at the Audio Swap Meet was lots of “junk” (old all-in-one units from unknown brands). Lots of tubes, which may or may not have worked. Some cheap kids turntable/speaker combos. Lots of misc connectors and wiring.

But, there were some folks that were (re) selling some quality gear, including the guy I want to swap the Magnepans with.

He actually has a brick and mortar store. He carries really good stuff...Martin Logan, Klipsch Heritage, B&W, VPI, etc. He mostly does custom installs and most of it for Home Theater. But, he deals in used equipment, too (thus, the audio swap meet).

He ended up buying the Magnepans yesterday. I didn’t lose any money on them (made a little) and he said he wouldn’t make a whole lot on them. But, he would set them up in his store and probably sell a higher margin Amp, Pre-Amp, etc to drive them.

Listened to his Klipsch Heritage speakers...first the Heresy and then the LaScalla. Mercy!!!!! Lots to be said for highly efficient, horn speakers. Both gave a HUGE soundstage and captured lots of energy of the recordings we demo’d. Couldn’t make Lacallas work (https://www.klipsch.com/products/la-scala-70th-anniversary-edition). They’re just too big.

But, I could make their little brother work (https://www.klipsch.com/products/heresy-iv-floorstanding-speaker).

These are NOT the Klipsch speakers you hear at Best Buy. The ones mentioned are “alive” in the way they sound. I found myself uncontrollably grinning listening to the Heresy. He was driving them to crazy sound levels with an 8 Watt tube amp. I can’t even imagine what they’d sound like with a 80W-100W solid state amp.

3469,Jul-31,graphicguy,"Back to cars.....set up an appointment for my first oil change for the Stinger next week. Dealership is offering pick up and delivery service for their service dept. That’s not something I expect to continue for a long time, but certainly convenient.

Time to take stock. I look forward to driving the Stinger every day. It’s just a fun, fast, comfortable car to drive on a daily basis. It has a firmer ride than my TLX. But, it’s still comfortable and not objectionable. Still wish I had my ELS stereo back. But, the Harmon Kardon in the Stinger does sound good.

No squeaks, no rattles. Every thing works well. Even minor features like wipers that come on when it rains, or the automatic headlight dimmers, etc....works better than I’d hoped.

Brembo brakes make me feel more confident in its stopping power than I should probably be. But, they work better than any brakes I’ve had on ANY car I’ve owned. I’ll run out of nerve before it runs out of cornering ability. Steering is electric, but feels more connected than any hydraulic steering systems I can recall.

It feels faster than when I first bought it. But, it’s hotter out now than when I bought it, too. By my manual calculations, I’m getting 28 MPG on all highway, got a low 0f 19 MPG in all city driving, and am averaging 22 MPG overall. That’s on PUG. Plus, I leave it in SPORT all the time. My foot tends to be heavy on the right pedal, too.

Even though I rarely think about ergonomics, I was able to reach everything and operate all the features within a few days of ownership. For good or ill, the safety tech is really good (especially the radar/laser cruise and tracking). Infotainment is good. I use the NAV in the Stinger more than I do Apple Maps, which is a testament to the software Kia uses for their infotainment.

I’ve hauled my bicycle, 4’ tall speakers, my dog’s crate, 4 people, and other stuff, both animate and inanimate, in it (not all at the same time).

It has a double DIN stereo, so I figure I can swap out a CarPlay and XM equipped head unit; maybe look into upgrading the speakers.

Beyond that, for something I'll drive 5-6K per year, I don't think I'd miss a lot of the tech features. And, I'd still have the Subaru if I wanted something more modern.

What's good is that my insurance would actually go down if/when I add it to the policy - the multi-car discount I'd qualify for would be more than the cost of the comprehensive policy I'd put on the Sonata.

The question is does Canada count Covid deaths the same way as the U.S. does? It is suspected that the U.S. death toll is highly inflated as many people who are counted as a Covid death actually died of other causes like a motorcycle crash.
Counting is done different in different places, but our methods would be similar to yours. Using that as a reason for different counts is a real stretch.....some may be diagnosed incorrectly, but the large difference in numbers of infected (3X) and who died (almost double) proportionately is the important calculation.

It is the same sort of thing they do for drinking, smoking, vaping and countless other ills and behaviors. If you look closely at their studies on such subjects you will see them attribute X-number of deaths to whatever is under scrutiny. But usually people don't have a single cause of disease that results in death. That thing that kills you probably had several contributors that led to its onset. But if they're studying drinking, and you drank, it gets chalked up to that. The same for smoking or eating certain foods or using certain products or whatever. Sometimes they adjust it to generate a fractional cause but often they do not. Public Health studies are among the worst I have seen for misleading the reader.

Talked to my sister yesterday. She said Covid cases in the Dayton are are on the rise.
At one point, there were only a few people being hospitalized, but now the Covid section is at full capacity at the hospital where her husband is a doctor.
So here's a graph, data, for Dayton (Ohio). The riots were about May 30 as a reference for
when the cases spread and increased over the next two weeks and cascaded through contacts
as the cold virus spread.



In the first graph the last data point shows 5 new hospitalizations. The lowest bar is just before July 1 and that was a ""1"" for comparison on height, since there are no vertical axes labeled here. The total hospitalizations for the life of the cold/flu virus Sars2 is 554 which doesn't include 42 for which no date of entry is known.

The second chart is deaths which are attributed to China Virus, although that includes many questionable credits for those who died of other causes but had Covid or even were exposed to same such as by contact with a family member. My doctor sources says even a terminal cancer death was attributed to the Covid19.
The shortest bar is a ""1.""

The last chart is presumed recovered and is updated through July 7, 2020 and the height of that final entry is 73 cases.

The same doctor mentioned above pointed out in April that there was a whole hospital shut down in downtown for China Virus and it was ""empty"" according to the person in charge. No Covid patients and now regular patients.

We have more than one hospital and now the hospitals are handling other patients including surgeries and routine procedures. Another downtown hospital apparently was the primary landing for Covid patients. There are 3 large downtown area hospitals and 3 perimeter hospitals. Normally ICU units are sized in the allocations from the State when they allow new hospital beds to have 95% occupancy. So nearly full may mean the patient goes to another of the 6 area hospitals.

Luckily I had my colonoscopy just a few days before shutdown in a clinic attached to one of our satellite hospitals. I couldn't have survived having to dread the procedure for 3 months until full operations resumed.

3506,Jul-30,andres3,"So some of the cat is out of the bag regarding my insurance disputed between Progressive and USAA and the low-IQ Arbitration company they agreed to use between themselves.

Progressive wasn't fighting for that last 10% on my behalf for my interests, they were doing it for their own!

USAA paid me 90% instead of 70% because I complained to the Dept. of Insurance for their terrible handling (slow and delayed and ridiculous) of my December claim. They also made ""payments in advance"" of judgment, which is very rare for insurance companies to do!

The Arbitrator sliced me to 80%, so I got shorted $100 on my deductible by Progressive.

Turns out Progressive wanted to go to the arbitrator not for my 10% but for the dispute they were having with USAA on the repair bill!!!!! Something like 64% of the initial 70% was initially paid by USAA to Progressive. They needed arbitration to settle their own arguments with the repair bill!!! The 30 or 10% liability dispute was a ""side matter"" for them.

While the liability was my main concern, it certainly wasn't Progressive's! They'd have probably more smartly settled at 90% if the other items were not in dispute, as I would have settled for 90%.

Therefore, I'm asking USAA to give me another $100 to honor their previous letter stating they'll accept 90% blame, since I had nothing to do with BIASED ARBITRATION FORUMS INC.

In this way, I've suggested to them, we'll avoid small claims court and re-litigating this in a fairer venue. It's in both our interests to settle the matter.

I'm not necessarily bluffing either. I may want my pound of flesh. I don't like going backwards, and going 10% backwards from 90 to 80 is a bridge too far.

I'm sticking to my worldview that Insurance companies are pure evil employing nothing but rogues of humanity. This claim has not changed that viewpoint at all.

In the U.S. they are counting all deaths of those infected as a Civid death regardless of the actual cause. Because of this the death count is inflated.
Could be happening here too...no exact rules about counting deaths. Some covid deaths may be counted as something else too. But, our numbers are on a downswing now....that can change but that is a fact. Also, none of our hospitals are close to being strained at this time.

If you look at the charts below, it's clear it takes about two weeks for all death to be reported from a particular day. This probably means many more people died already and we are just starting seeing results of this early infection spike from late June now (which is still continuing at similar same rate). It takes two to four weeks for those acute cases to end terminally. I'm afraid we're going to see thousands or even tens of thousands of new dead in Florida in next month if not two.

Already the local TV stations are ramping up the forecasts for this tropical storm. They state we should stock up on batteries, food, water, etc. They are not predicting a hurricane but a strong tropical storm. They do not know where in Florida it will hit because the center of circulation has not developed yet.

This is the difference between hurricanes/tropical storms, earthquakes and tornadoes. With tornadoes and earthquakes, they come and go within minutes. With storms like this, you are in a sort of suspended animation for 5-7 days while the storm is tracked.
That is much better for the weathertainment TV ratings.

Simple answer is British Columbia has a very low rate of covid...Alberta's is a bit higher. Provinces that are doing better don't want visitors from provinces with higher rates. It seems to be helping.

Then Vancouver went off the charts because of the immigration wave you mention, Seattle followed some time later, now both are unaffordable to normal working people (but Vancouver does a better job with upzoning, Seattle can be really NIMBY about it). The lower mainland is just like Seattle, full of transplants, some loved more than others.

The traffic can be insane there, but I live in the middle of traffic hell, so it's no different. At least they were smart enough to put in a light rail line when it was easier to build. I've always seen Vancouver as a cleaner somewhat more developed version of Seattle.

I pointed out that NOT being a dealer and having them in his inventory would bring in new customers that he may not see.

He threw out a number which I wasn’t interested. He wants to check how much he has in his speakers, which he said he didn’t know off the top of his head.

Not sure if I've mentioned here, but my mom has stopped driving, and we recently moved her into a full time care facility close to my sister in San Diego. My sister has taken possession of my moms car - 2003 Hyundai Sonata GLS V6 with all of 39,000 miles on it.

My sister took it to her trusted independent mechanic (her FIL used him for 20+ years). Based on feedback from the CCBA thread, I was expecting belts, hoses, tires to need attention, along with other deferred maintenance.

Turns out it only needed an oil change and a transmission fluid flush - $250 total.

To say I was surprised would be an understatement.

It does need some cosmetic work done - it's missing some of the chrome window trim, and the passenger side rear view mirror is cracked and needs to be replaced.

Mechanically, the cruise control doesn't work, and there is a known issue with the fuel filler setup that makes it difficult to fill the gas tank.

Her kids will be driving it to Atascadero on Saturday for a wedding - just over 300 miles, one way.

Eventually, when I can get out to California, I'll drive the Sonata back and make it my DD.

Got a call back on the Charger. Went through the list. Oil change, coolant change, trans service, brake fluid change, intake cleaning, new oil pressure sender, thermostat, tightened up various components on the front end, alignment, tire rotation and balance .... $3300! He wanted another $700 for spark plugs, but I turned that down. Not sure what the heck that's about, but the plugs cost about $50 and are all easily accessible. Even if it took 3 hrs (which it shouldn't), that's about $470 at their rates. He says it will be a whole new car. Told him for 1/3rd the purchase price, I hope so.

I'm just chalking it up to a learning experience. Probably could have done all those fluids, sender, and thermostat for about $400. Then get the alignment, rotation, and balance done for ... what? $300? $400? $2500 in labor is ... wow. I could spend 30 of my own hours and it would still be worth it.

@qbrozen - ouch!

Not sure if I've mentioned here, but my mom has stopped driving, and we recently moved her into a full time care facility close to my sister in San Diego. My sister has taken possession of my moms car - 2003 Hyundai Sonata GLS V6 with all of 39,000 miles on it.

My sister took it to her trusted independent mechanic (her FIL used him for 20+ years). Based on feedback from the CCBA thread, I was expecting belts, hoses, tires to need attention, along with other deferred maintenance.

Turns out it only needed an oil change and a transmission fluid flush - $250 total.

To say I was surprised would be an understatement.

It does need some cosmetic work done - it's missing some of the chrome window trim, and the passenger side rear view mirror is cracked and needs to be replaced.

Mechanically, the cruise control doesn't work, and there is a known issue with the fuel filler setup that makes it difficult to fill the gas tank.

Her kids will be driving it to Atascadero on Saturday for a wedding - just over 300 miles, one way.

Eventually, when I can get out to California, I'll drive the Sonata back and make it my DD.

The question is does Canada count Covid deaths the same way as the U.S. does? It is suspected that the U.S. death toll is highly inflated as many people who are counted as a Covid death actually died of other causes like a motorcycle crash.
You mean if someone dies in a motorcycle crash and they test positive (even if no symptoms) they'll blame Covid-19? Seems like similar logic to blaming speed.

Speed and Corona are the scapegoats.

Ah man, you gotta be kidding me. In 1967, a few months after I was married, I bought the Lafayette Model LR-1000 TA which was the 120 watt version (60 watts per channel). I was waiting and waiting for Fisher to introduce their 60 watts per channel transistor model but no one had it. Finally one Saturday night I walked by a Lafayette Electronics store and there it was in the window. I was excited and immediately went in to buy it but the salesman asked me to at least listen to the LR-1000 transistor unit before I bought. I did and it sounded better and was even less expensive. So I bought it and Lafayette speakers and a Girard turntable with a Sure cartridge.

When I went to work the following Monday I told an audiophile guy what I bought and he very disappointed in me almost to the point he didn’t even want to talk to me anymore because we had talked a few times about me wanting to buy the Fisher unit although he wanted me to buy a Marantz job. That was out of my budget so he felt a Fisher would be just barely OK but he went off on me when I told him I bought the Lafayette unit.

Fast forward a few months and he shows me the cover of one of his audiophile rags where they rated the Lafayette unit as very good. Not high end good but damn good for the price and even beat out the Fisher I originally wanted to buy. So we were on speaking terms again but he was still a Marantz guy...all the way through to the bone.

I have a bunch of Pioneer stuff, most all of it in storage downstairs. I bought a SX-3600 Fluoroscan receiver in 1980/81, one of the first things I bought with money from my first job. Wanted the 3700 but it was a bit too expensive for me (should have found the money for it in retrospect). Used it for years. Around 13-14 years ago I decided to see if I could bring it back and it worked straight up out of the box, so it is hooked up downstairs along with a turntable and a CD player. That got me interested in silver Pioneer stuff again and via a well-known auction site I acquired a SX-880, a SX-3800 and the aforementioned 3900 over a few years time. I've been thinking of recommissiong the 3800 to take the place of the 3900 when/if I decide it needs a cleaning.

OK...I kind of wondered if Sight and Sound was a chain....apparently it was, but not the same store as we had here in SW OH. I went to the one on Queen City Ave all the time. Huge (at least to me) audio gear and record store. They had some other, smaller stores peppered throughout Cincinnati at the time.

Agree.....Swallens was really beyond description. Bought my stereo gear there, bought albums, bought my first washer/dryer and microwave, my first stove....probably spent thousands of dollars there back in the late ‘80s. Went to the one on Red Bank road and the one in Springdale (as I lived in Wyoming OH at the time).

Pioneer and Marantz is what I really wanted, but didn’t have enough money to buy. First money I made went to buy a Sansui Stereo Receiver, a Kenwood turntable (with a granite-like base) and JBL 100 Speakers with foam grills (which I read were just re-released). I added a Nakamichi tape deck later.

Wish I still had that system. Got me through High School, College and the first home I purchased. Probably be worth a pretty penny today. Just curious about how it would sound if put up against the stuff I have today.

@roadburner ....I briefly had that same Carver Receiver. It was a heavy beast that had gobs of power. Ended up trading it for a self propelled mower. Bad move on my part.
I believe that the 6250 was one of the last pieces of equipment Bob Carver designed before he moved to Sunfire. Those magnetic field amps were beasts. I almost bought one of his CD players that had a tube amplification stage.

3622,Jul-27,graphicguy,"@ab348 ....I know a couple of “Willy-wavers”. I can only take about 5 mins with them. For some reason, they seem to seek me out when we’re in a group. Maybe it’s because I’m polite and will listen to them for 5 mins and nod like I care (I don’t).

Live music reproduction in your home....not happening. No matter how much you spend, you’ll never reproduce that. Pro musicians have huge venues to play in. And overall, they have pro-audio equipment to fill those venues.

But, you can spend some money (OK....a LOT of money) and get a relatively holographic sound with your stereo system where the speakers disappear and your room seems to expand where the sound seemingly comes from beyond your walls and ceiling. Neat party trick, but nowhere near a live concert in a venue made for live concerts.

@roadburner ....that Hanson Audio place was a Field of Dreams type of venue. You can drop buckets and buckets of cash there. They had some B&W Nautilus speakers playing that consumed me for about 30 minutes. And, I would have listened longer if they hadn’t kindly asked if they could do another demo for someone. What they were really saying was “get out of the way so we can sell something to someone who can actually afford these”. The speakers alone cost $60,000 (you read that right). Who knows how much the electronics cost they used to drive them.

I will say this...they had a nice home theater set up that they were demoing. My guess is it probably cost 4x-5x more than my set up. I still say mine looks and sounds better. I have yet to see or hear anything better than my set up. For that, I’ll wallow in the sadness that I don’t have an unending stream of cash to make it sound even better.

So, I set up the Magnepans in my home theater room, as that’s where I have everything set up. Spent a couple of hours with them just trying to get their positioning right. My Denon can drive them and does a credible job while doing it. They don’t have much in the way of low end reproduction, so they would need a subwoofer. The mids and highs are glorious, though.

Downsides....again, they need a sub. To get the “glorious” sound, the listening position is very small and you have to stay there. Not a problem for me as I’d just set up a recliner in the “sweet spot”. You move a little left or right of the “sweet spot” and the holographic nature of them collapses, and they just sound thin and lifeless.

I can’t integrate them in my Home Theater set up. So, unless I drop more cash into a pre-amp, amp and a source (turntable, streamer, etc), they will get shoved into my closet of forgotten audio gear in the hopes I can resurrect them some day.

Don’t make fun, but the GF loves “PINK”. I let her listen to Pink after I got the speakers dialed in. Her reply? “I don’t know why you spent so much time setting these up. What’s so special about them? Take me out for dinner.”

So much for my wish to have her enable me.

I had heard that. You have nothing to lose. But, once you crack open the case, and start applying heat, I would imagine it would have to be hot enough to at least soften the solder, which could lead to a lot of other issues. Worth a shot, though.

You don't think things will change but they do. I have a friend who was a tremendously good golfer. First, the flexibility and strength started to go, so couldn't play competitively by about 65. By 70 he felt he has played his best golf, he has been there done that....no interest in playing any more.

Cars.....I used to get excited about getting a new car. I have about 20000 miles on the E400, absolutely no desire to shop for a new car. Even if I wanted a new one I don't want to get used to a new one, and it would be a waste financially. So, I think our wants and needs change as we get older.

Could it be that you've reached the pinnacle of your automotive desires with the E400? Perhaps you've satisfied your urges for a great car. There is the law of diminishing returns when you get to a very high level car.

I'd prefer a TTRS to a TTS, but really, the improvements are just incremental.

2 points for a ""damaged/un-repaired collision mitigation device out on the freeway where you could impact an unmovable object.

If you think that sucks what do you think about this:

I got a robo call this morning about final expense insurance. I hung up immediately but I did hear that much. Mrs. j was in the kitchen and asked who called. I told her and she quips, “you know, you otta start paying attention to those kind of calls now”. I’ll see how she feels in about 3 weeks when she’ll be as old as me. If I felt up to it I shoulda chased her around the dining room table for a lap or two. Would have served her right.

What is really driving me nuts are the 5-6 robo-calls I get each week from some auto warranty company. They are the most persistent of all the robo-calls I get. I have blocked 40-50 phone numbers but they keep changing their phone number.

It is so aggravating I feel like throwing the darn phone against the wall at times. But I quickly remember that replacing this iPhone would be pretty pricey.🤓

I see Audi as being the better Acura for former Honda Owners, at least in years past (no one knows the future). If Audi delivers a reliable experience similar to what one is used to with their Honda's, it's a win-win!!

For those that get bad Audi's, well, there's always Lexus.

Seems like Acura has gotten some Mojo back lately though. You're 2006 TL is the last generation Acura I REALLY craved. The new TLX-S(A-Spec) shows promise.

I know I was sad when my test drive of an early IS350 led me to believe the TL-S would get gapped by one.

@roadburner ....that Hanson Audio place was a Field of Dreams type of venue. You can drop buckets and buckets of cash there. They had some B&W Nautilus speakers playing that consumed me for about 30 minutes. And, I would have listened longer if they hadn’t kindly asked if they could do another demo for someone. What they were really saying was “get out of the way so we can sell something to someone who can actually afford these”. The speakers alone cost $60,000 (you read that right). Who knows how much the electronics cost they used to drive them.

I will say this...they had a nice home theater set up that they were demoing. My guess is it probably cost 4x-5x more than my set up. I still say mine looks and sounds better. I have yet to see or hear anything better than my set up. For that, I’ll wallow in the sadness that I don’t have an unending stream of cash to make it sound even better.

So, I set up the Magnepans in my home theater room, as that’s where I have everything set up. Spent a couple of hours with them just trying to get their positioning right. My Denon can drive them and does a credible job while doing it. They don’t have much in the way of low end reproduction, so they would need a subwoofer. The mids and highs are glorious, though.

Downsides....again, they need a sub. To get the “glorious” sound, the listening position is very small and you have to stay there. Not a problem for me as I’d just set up a recliner in the “sweet spot”. You move a little left or right of the “sweet spot” and the holographic nature of them collapses, and they just sound thin and lifeless.

I can’t integrate them in my Home Theater set up. So, unless I drop more cash into a pre-amp, amp and a source (turntable, streamer, etc), they will get shoved into my closet of forgotten audio gear in the hopes I can resurrect them some day.
I rarely find HTS systems I prefer to mine; I usually find the sub is too loud as are the surround speakers- I guess so the unknowing will ""appreciate"" the system.

I almost bought some cheaper Maggies back in 1991. I ended up with my Klipsch KG4s, as I liked the sound and the high sensitivity paired well with my Carver receiver. I'll give you $200 for them...

My bride-bless her heart-never questions my need for 155 mph daily drivers or an elaborate HTS. And did I mention she found my first BMW for me and also gave me a Tag Heuer watch for a wedding present and another one for our 30th anniversary? Needless to say, I don't begrudge her remodeling projects or any of her other interests.

@stickguy I’ll pretty much have the same commute again that I had for years. Office is in Cherry Hill only about two miles from my old Moorestown office. It sounds like after the initial training that I may be able to transition to WFH. I’ll also have some light travel again, which is no big deal.
Congrats on the new gig.

This past winter I did my monthly start up on the Sebring. Got occupied elsewhere and discovered it still running 5 hours later. Didn’t seem to hurt it at all. They say an hour of idle is equal to 30 or so miles driven. I’ve seen cop car with over 8000 idle hours.
It's my understanding that police cars spend at idle least as much time as they are being driven.

So air flows more freely.....trapping fewer contaminates which is why most people have a filter. Wouldn't it be better to buy a better filter, and change it more frequently?

Finished up the Home Theater install last night. My friend is very pleased, so I’m pleased. Wouldn’t have chosen some of the components he bought (Sony AV Receivers....blech!!!!). But, it does sounds fine. Not sure how it will do if pushed on something like the Avengers, the Lord of the Rings movies, Man of Steel, etc...may send the Receiver into overload/protect mode. But, the stuff we tested it with, it’s OK. I like the Paradigm speakers he partnered with the rest of his system. Although, the sub woofers left me underwhelmed. I spent over an hour trying to coax them to perform better, but didn’t have much luck. He’s pleased with them, though.

Installation was pretty straight forward. Projector was a bit finicky. And, he’s run into the same problem as all projectors will have in a home application, if there’s any light that seeps into the room where it’s set up, the colors and picture tends to wash out. Not a big deal if you only use it at night, but during the day, it will be an issue. I suggested he get some window coverings (which his wife wants no part of).

Told him I’d “try” the Magnepans with the understanding if I didn’t like them, they’d come back to him. It was 10-ish p.m. by the time I got home from the installation. They actually fit in the Stinger (with the back seats down). Messed around with them until 1:00 a.m. It’s clear they need some hefty current. While my Denon Receiver is no slouch, I get the distinct feeling I’m going to need something even more powerful.

You don't think things will change but they do. I have a friend who was a tremendously good golfer. First, the flexibility and strength started to go, so couldn't play competitively by about 65. By 70 he felt he has played his best golf, he has been there done that....no interest in playing any more.

You don't think things will change but they do. I have a friend who was a tremendously good golfer. First, the flexibility and strength started to go, so couldn't play competitively by about 65. By 70 he felt he has played his best golf, he has been there done that....no interest in playing any more.

Cars.....I used to get excited about getting a new car. I have about 20000 miles on the E400, absolutely no desire to shop for a new car. Even if I wanted a new one I don't want to get used to a new one, and it would be a waste financially. So, I think our wants and needs change as we get older.

Sorry but I still get excited by a new car, even if it’s some old beater. Never cared about fancy clothes and never had the money or expertise to care about high end audio. I’m certainly slowing down but I still managed to load my son’s furniture today when he moved.

In retrospect, at 63 I was still a young man, and physically, mentally, and lifestyle wise, nothing much had changed in my life. Still felt the same in early 70's. Now, at 77, I can certainly tell the difference between now and when I was 63, or even when 73. Still healthy for my age and have ""shot my age"" at least once on the golf course since I was 72...but I am certainly not as strong as I once was and don't have the stamina to play 36 or more holes a day, nor do I have the desire to play that much.

I believe that men also go through a ""change of life"", just as a woman does. It is a slow process over a 2 or 3 year period and you don't really notice it until it is complete. Different ages for everyone I assume, but it will happen if you live long enough. At 77 I am different, but just as content and satisfied with my life as ever, maybe even more so. Getting old is not all good, but not all bad either.
77, you’re just a kid. Being today is my birthday I just added one to that age. Spent the whole day helping Son #1 at flip house #2. I don’t think I’m any more tired than when we did flip #1 last Summer. I guess some things never change except for the number of candles on the cake.

Wow
I have the same Lennox box for the filter with the same sticker. I even keep purchasing the same Lennox branded filters with Merv 11 ratings for filtration level. The filters were to be replaced _once_ per year. They suggested calling the company for service to do the filter change.

I buy the filters 5 in a box from Ebay. I ordered the first time mid afternoon and they were here the next day by noon. I figured out the Ebay source was a company near Cincinnati, so things got delivered fast.

I replace them at about 4 months so the electrostatic effect is fresher and still working. I can imagine one of these after year. But there's a whole lot of surface area in those pleats.



They did put @explorerx4's filter in the wrong place. Mine is on top of the furnace box.

I have one that’s similar, and actually in the same place on my HVAC. But, mine’s an “Aprilaire”. Not sure it really matters as it’s just a place where the air filter goes, albeit it’s a much bigger and thicker filter than the ones you see in HVAC systems with “normal” filters.

So maybe if we could all make an extra effort to be kind to each other and the people we encounter it would help us all get through this very difficult time. That’s all.
I didn’t say you were perpetually offended but you seemed to focus on my jargon rather than my message. I agree that low level workers take a lot of abuse for the actions of the larger company. That’s not fair. That’s why I made a point of reassuring the worker that I didn’t hold her responsible for the company’s policies. I know what that’s like. When we would transport cars to dealers the sales managers would occasionally berate the drivers over some minor scratch or missing option as if we had personally caused it. Wasn’t a lot of fun.

Speaking of jargon, I once lost a professional job I was interviewing for because the interviewer took exception to me using the word “lingo” when referring to learning new terms specific to that industry. Everyone has their trigger I guess.

OK...as we’re want to do in here, I’m going to go down an audio rabbit hole with this post. You’ve been warned.

A good friend of mine (who just retired from Intel, my former competitor) just dropped a bundle on a new Home Theater System. He’s prone to have more money than sense (something I can sometimes relate to). He didn’t build it up over time. He wrote a check and got a projector, a screen, an AV Receiver, 11 speakers, sundry wiring and accessories delivered. He’s a neophyte when it comes to audio, but that’s what friends are for.

We started on it last night (this installation is going to take a couple more nights to complete). He had his basement finished for Home Theater use. Not unlike mine except I made an entire play room out of mine which included a home theater set up.

I quizzed him about why he didn’t have the store set it up for him. He said they wanted to charge too much. Understand, he just dropped well into five figures on equipment, but wouldn’t spend ~$1,000-$2,000 to have it all professionally installed. Again, I suppose that’s what friends are for.

We got it all unboxed and hoofed it down to his Home Theater room. Started taking measurements and running cable through the walls and ceiling. Got the projector installed in a ceiling perch and the screen into the motorized lift. I was pleased with how much we got done, but there’s a lot more to do.

We called it a night and he rewarded me with a snifter of my favorite bourbon (Basil Hayden). I had noticed he had what looked like shelving tucked into a corner of his den. But, they were weird looking shelves. Asked him about them.

He walked up and pulled them out of the corner. They were these....

https://www.magnepan.com/model_lrs

This is not a well known speaker manufacturer, but are revered to those who know of them.

He said they sounded terrible but was out of the period where he could return them.

These speakers need lots of current to sound good. A $500 AV Receiver won’t cut it. Plus, they send a signal both forward and back. So, they need room to “breathe”. They have to be set up well into the room to sound right. No shoving them against a wall. I’ve not heard the particular speakers this guy had, but have heard numerous Magnepans in the past. They’re unlike anything you’ve ever heard and are glorious when set up correctly. I relayed this information. He said he was “over them” and asked if I would be interested in them.

Magnepans tend to cost on the high side of stereo speakers....$2K to start and go up from there.

He said the ones he has cost $700 and offered them to me for $250 because I was helping him. Great deal....they’re only 6 moths old and were used a handful of times before shoved into a corner.

Downside....these are only good for a two channel system. Even though the cost of entry is cheap, the electronics to drive them would be hefty. Plus, you need room....lots of room. I guess I could convert one of my bedrooms into a listening room. So much for putting my house on the market to downsize.

Not sure I want to go down that road. But, I know what these things sound like. And, they are fantastic in a total sense, not just for the money.

But, I’m finding myself looking at High Current amps and pre-amps that might couple well with them.

We’re back at the install tonight. I’ll have to inspect them more closely.

Their job description mentioned twice that I would be driving a “kick [non-permissible content removed]” delivery vehicle and I should have a good personality so the buyer wouldn’t think the process “sucked”.

Fact is, you can stream decent sounding music anywhere, carry your entire music collection on your phone, and not be stuck listening in a single room of your home to hear it.

At one point, I had 2,000 vinyl albums (that I wish I had today). A goodly amount of them were quite rare and out of print, no doubt worth a nice sum today. I kept them all pristine. Sold them all, and all the associated equipment to play them, when my former spouse and I split. Today, those albums would probably fetch $25,000-$30,000. C’est la Vie!

I need to get my friend’s speakers hooked up to see if any equipment I’ve got will drive them. Not sure if I want them. But, for the money, I guess I could buy them and stick them in a corner to gather dust, too.

We got a picture and sound out of his Home Theater set up last night. We connected the left, center, right, left and right surround, left and right rear surround speakers. Then, we connect the left and right “height” speakers in the ceiling. Got the (2) subwoofers connected. Got his Projector, Blue Ray player and the speakers connected to his Sony ES AV Receiver (Not my cup of tea, but it seems relatively robust). The Sony ES has a weak “auto-speaker set up” feature. I’ll have to do that by ear/hand. I’ll set speaker distances, set crossovers, adjust SPL (with my handy dandy Radio Shack SPL meter we talked about a little while ago), etc.

None of it’s dialed in. Still need to adjust the projector, too. But, I expect I’ll get all that done today. And, the job will be finished.

3806,Jul-24,Michaell,"@graphicguy - seems like you've enjoyed yourself setting up this system for your friend. I'm probably at the opposite end of the audiophile spectrum. I did have a surround sound system in the first house I owned. Since we bought new construction, I had the family room pre-wired for the speakers, then went to a well known audio store here in Denver to get a specific model to install.

Now, it's a soundbar and wireless sub in the current house.

A total bummer about the vinyl. I had a few vinyl albums back in the day, but ditched them around the time CD's became popular. Now I'd like to pick up a turntable and a few select albums just for the 'warmth' of the music - problem is, I don't really have anywhere in my house to set up a turntable.

For those of you who are into vinyl, I recommend the book ""The Revenge of Analog"", which talks about not only vinyl albums, but also notebooks (Moleskine, predominantly), board games, real film for photos, and the like.

It's nice to take a break from the digital world from time to time.

OK...as we’re want to do in here, I’m going to go down an audio rabbit hole with this post. You’ve been warned.

A good friend of mine (who just retired from Intel, my former competitor) just dropped a bundle on a new Home Theater System. He’s prone to have more money than sense (something I can sometimes relate to). He didn’t build it up over time. He wrote a check and got a projector, a screen, an AV Receiver, 11 speakers, sundry wiring and accessories delivered. He’s a neophyte when it comes to audio, but that’s what friends are for.

We started on it last night (this installation is going to take a couple more nights to complete). He had his basement finished for Home Theater use. Not unlike mine except I made an entire play room out of mine which included a home theater set up.

I quizzed him about why he didn’t have the store set it up for him. He said they wanted to charge too much. Understand, he just dropped well into five figures on equipment, but wouldn’t spend ~$1,000-$2,000 to have it all professionally installed. Again, I suppose that’s what friends are for.

We got it all unboxed and hoofed it down to his Home Theater room. Started taking measurements and running cable through the walls and ceiling. Got the projector installed in a ceiling perch and the screen into the motorized lift. I was pleased with how much we got done, but there’s a lot more to do.

We called it a night and he rewarded me with a snifter of my favorite bourbon (Basil Hayden). I had noticed he had what looked like shelving tucked into a corner of his den. But, they were weird looking shelves. Asked him about them.

He walked up and pulled them out of the corner. They were these....

https://www.magnepan.com/model_lrs

This is not a well known speaker manufacturer, but are revered to those who know of them.

He said they sounded terrible but was out of the period where he could return them.

These speakers need lots of current to sound good. A $500 AV Receiver won’t cut it. Plus, they send a signal both forward and back. So, they need room to “breathe”. They have to be set up well into the room to sound right. No shoving them against a wall. I’ve not heard the particular speakers this guy had, but have heard numerous Magnepans in the past. They’re unlike anything you’ve ever heard and are glorious when set up correctly. I relayed this information. He said he was “over them” and asked if I would be interested in them.

Magnepans tend to cost on the high side of stereo speakers....$2K to start and go up from there.

He said the ones he has cost $700 and offered them to me for $250 because I was helping him. Great deal....they’re only 6 moths old and were used a handful of times before shoved into a corner.

Downside....these are only good for a two channel system. Even though the cost of entry is cheap, the electronics to drive them would be hefty. Plus, you need room....lots of room. I guess I could convert one of my bedrooms into a listening room. So much for putting my house on the market to downsize.

Not sure I want to go down that road. But, I know what these things sound like. And, they are fantastic in a total sense, not just for the money.

But, I’m finding myself looking at High Current amps and pre-amps that might couple well with them.

We’re back at the install tonight. I’ll have to inspect them more closely.
I got just the 2-channel hefty super strong high current pre-amp you need, but you'll have to pay top dollar for it. It's an old Denon INTEGRATED AMP (one of the last good things they sold a decade ago) unit with 80 watts at 8 Ohm and 160W at 4 Ohm just like a perfectly designed amp should put out and weighs north of 50 pounds. Not sure I want to get rid of it, hence the top dollar request Works perfectly, and still have the super basic remote.

99% sure it's this relatively ""modern"" old-school bad boy: https://www.crutchfield.com/S-ABSdL36EGHQ/p_033PMA2KIV/Denon-PMA-2000IVR.html

I probably wouldn't settle for a Camry either...I mean I am still breathing. I loved my BMW convertible, but wouldn't consider another BMW Cabriolet because I can't be bothered messing around with snow tires anymore. My AWD is good enough to get through most snow.

Not unusual today. Back then, very high tech. It was a big honker, installed right on my dash with the “pig tail” antenna attached on my back windshield. Business calls were covered. Personal calls were not. You would think that’s not a big deal for them to cover personal calls, but then, the charges were by the minute, and if I was in a remote locale (outside the local area codes), the per minute charges went up for “long distance”.

Call quality was terrible. Coverage was dismal, at best. They ended up going back to using pagers to reach me (or have me call them). Back then, if your copier went down, your business ground to a halt.

Problem was, to have the phone ripped out of my car would have left a bunch of screw holes in the dash. Since the phone technically belonged to the company, they allegedly wanted it back after going to pagers. I told them if that were the case, they needed to fix the holes in my dash. They never asked for the phone to be returned, again (IIRC, it cost ~$1,000+). I left the holes. When I sold the car a couple of years later, I left the phone in (non-activated) and used the phone as a selling feature.

By then, I had climbed up the corporate ladder enough to get a company car (a Mercury Sable, which at the time, was state of the art in design). They went back to us having cell phones. But, this time, they were using Motorola Microtac, the first flip phone. No installation needed except for a “signal booster” in the car to make reception better.

I liked the way Lethal Weapon movies explored the youth culture plot with violence and cell phones.

Danny Glover wasn't only worried about his new young partner when he complains, ""I'm getting too old for this...""

The real visual for that scene was this futuristic 1987 portable cell phone which only the kids could love and appreciate.

Lethal Weapon 4 showcased Joe Pesci having an old man rage about cell phones in a scene with Chris Rock.

""They get you with cell phones!""

Years ago a nurse at my doctor's office heard me complain about Kroger pharmacy making me wait at the store to pick up meds even after they left messages on my phone that the prescriptions were ""ready."" She gave me a card for a local pharmacy which offered home delivery and a way to let go of one old man rant.

By the way have you ever needed to contact your friendly, caring big box store pharmacy after biz hours? The mom and pop pharmacy which I switched to not only delivers, the owner gave me his cell phone number in case of some after hours issue. That's how they get ya kid!

It's true that many failings were ""self-inflicted."" And you're right that is a hard thing to make peace with on top of everything else including the profiteering.

Long term care facilities have long term and well-documented issues which were brutally exposed by COVID-19. And they account for over 40% coronavirus deaths in the U.S. Poor staffing and training, dwindling resources and reimbursement, inappropriate care for everything from passing meds to failing to assess needs for acute care transport, ""infection control is out of control"" and on like that.

I was at a usual morning stand up meeting at the administrator's office where the topic switched to updated advance directive forms signed by residents. One resident had signed his advance directive declaring full code status. That document was held up by my boss who stated, ""That's going to be a slow code!"" Said it out loud in front of all the dept directors at stand up. Disgusting. And illegal behavior just like yelling ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater.

All this was happening at nursing homes decades before Covid-19. Also prior to this pandemic I read a credible report from John's Hopkins stating that medication errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the U.S. Another self-inflicted wound which was a known problem prior to Covid-19.

Med errors include pharmacy errors of course and doesn't matter if it's hospital or mom and pop pharmacy. Local Dr Husel was charged with 25 counts of murder for giving lethal doses of Fentanyl to his patients. No nurse or pharmacist will face criminal charges along with Dr. Husel.

The doc must write med orders in compliance. Pharmacy must dispense in compliance and nurses must pass the meds in compliance. And administration is responsible for daily ops and ensuring quality of patient care. Mount Carmel West was performing joint commission required death review at the same time Dr. Husel was still on staff and killing more patients. Sucks to be Dr. Husel but are we really going to stop there? Nobody else going to trial?

So at least 25 cases of over-medicated patients dying as every link in the chain of quality and continuity of care was broken. Before Covid-19.

Here's an excerpt from a July 11 update by Mount Carmel.

""After many months, our review of patient cases under the care of Dr. William Husel has come to a conclusion. As we have done throughout this process, we have an update to share with our colleagues, patient families and community about what we have learned and the actions we are taking to chart a new path for Mount Carmel and ensure this never happens again.""

I used to have a great pharmacy/pharmacist, but he retired from the biz and every pharmacy I've dealt with since has been various degrees of awful. None of them big-box either. The one prior to my current one was just terrible. Used them for years and I swear that every single time I went there to pick up a Rx that they called to tell me was ready, they couldn't find it. It was uncanny. Plus they always treated me like I was a first-timer, no recognition that I was the guy who was in there every other week, even when dealing with the same staff person at the counter. Add to that being given someone else's drugs, long waits because everyone ahead of you at the counter was also experiencing problems, being overcharged because their computer system didn't recognize my drug plan, all sorts of snafus. I finally bailed on them a year or so back.

But all pharmacies across Canada got a self-inflicted black eye when COVID hit. Citing concerns over potential drug shortages, they all went to dispensing no more than a 30-day supply starting around the end of March. Now there were no unusual shortages then but OK, I could understand their concern. But that meant a couple of things: they were making people come into the place 3 times as often at a time when people were avoiding such contact. And even better, they were charging the same co-pay/dispensing fee for the 30 day supply that they did for a 90 day supply. So you were now paying that 3 times as much too, with them claiming that they were doing 3 times the work so why not? Well, that was their decision, not the customers, that's why not. But because it was a nationwide decision by their professional association there was no way for a customer to avoid it. It really bought them as a group a lot of ill-will because it seemed like profiteering in a crisis. No shortages ever emerged and the policy was quietly rolled back after 2 or 3 months.

Except they already had separate exit and entrance doors. They went to some pretty dramatic measures to make sure no one used the wrong one including using door monitors and fencing to funnel people into the correct door. Even weeks ago this cause some anger in customers who felt entitled in loud profane terms that they deserved to use any door they wanted. Well, this is Wally World after all.
You saw sometimes things like that done before Covid as a theft prevention measure, so some people may have felt ""caged"". The issue is as long as the message from the officials regarding seriousness and their subsequent actions are not consistent, you'll have some people behaving like a five-year-old whose parents refused to give a lolly pop and claiming they are martyrs for humanity's liberty.

3837,Jul-22,omarman,"@carnaught Sorry for your loss and at same time also thank you to everyone who works in healthcare.

Dr. Husel has become the poster child for ""bad doctor"" around here. I've never met or worked with him even though my family and I have had good experiences with staff, surgery and other tx at that same facility. But I have to offer my own disclaimer that I've had more arguments (not polite dfference of opinion) with more board certified physicians in just the last 10 years than I've ever had before in my life.

Those last ten years include the unfortunate change (my argument) to hospitalist inpt care as opposed to PCP care at the hospital. And the last 10 years also include my own unfortunate decline (no argument needed) into a +60 y/o boomer.

I can't really ID a bad guy poster for that situation but the ""declining reimbursement"" which I posted before makes it very unlikely to find any PCP doing rounds at my local hospital. Even if I can see their office from the hospital room window! What I do see on the unit white board is every ""patient name"" followed by ""Sound Physicians name.""

Continuity of care complaints from me have repeatedly arisen from that situation. Twice I've had to resort to contacting the PCP myself to dispute a medication order from the hospitalist. Once I had to complain to administration to persuade a hospitalist to return my phone calls after D/C regarding a totally incorrect assessment signed by him which I found in the D/C pack. He didn't deny that he got the assessment results wrong, but he accused an unnamed nurse for providing it. But it took 2 days of my life after D/C and help from hospital admin to get him to return my call and offer to redact the mistaken entry.

The masked unnamed nurse can't help me with that one! He stopped being my hospitalist as soon as he signed the D/C orders mistakes and all and left it to me and the PCP to deal with maybe a week or more after D/C. Argh!

""That’s not to say we should abandon looking for better ways of doing things right and always insure safety.""

That's weird.

But, air filters generally aren't tied to the furnace, but the attached duct work. I had a new Lennox installed about 4 years ago. But, the filter is still inserted in the same place, between the return air duct and the furnace body. I use the $1.00 specials and change them monthly (in theory).

Like others have stated, every HVAC tech I've talked to says don't use the HEPA filters, due to restricted airflow. Use the cheap fiberglass ones and change them often.

Telecom-related memories. I recall when I was a student in the late 90s, cellphones were still quite expensive, few of my friends had them. Even landline long distance plans could still be dear, so the smart move was to get a calling card at Costco for like $20, which gave you something like 700 minutes. I also remember in my early cellphone days, going outside the metro area would have you roaming, sometimes analog roaming - couldn't check voicemail etc. Or even 10 years ago, a few weeks in Europe might produce a bill of a few hundred dollars for roaming - it was advisable to have your phone unlocked and purchase a local SIM. Nowadays, with T-Mobile anyway, roaming and (throttled) data is almost free, no need to change anything.

3870,Jul-23,graphicguy,"OK...as we’re want to do in here, I’m going to go down an audio rabbit hole with this post. You’ve been warned.

A good friend of mine (who just retired from Intel, my former competitor) just dropped a bundle on a new Home Theater System. He’s prone to have more money than sense (something I can sometimes relate to). He didn’t build it up over time. He wrote a check and got a projector, a screen, an AV Receiver, 11 speakers, sundry wiring and accessories delivered. He’s a neophyte when it comes to audio, but that’s what friends are for.

We started on it last night (this installation is going to take a couple more nights to complete). He had his basement finished for Home Theater use. Not unlike mine except I made an entire play room out of mine which included a home theater set up.

I quizzed him about why he didn’t have the store set it up for him. He said they wanted to charge too much. Understand, he just dropped well into five figures on equipment, but wouldn’t spend ~$1,000-$2,000 to have it all professionally installed. Again, I suppose that’s what friends are for.

We got it all unboxed and hoofed it down to his Home Theater room. Started taking measurements and running cable through the walls and ceiling. Got the projector installed in a ceiling perch and the screen into the motorized lift. I was pleased with how much we got done, but there’s a lot more to do.

We called it a night and he rewarded me with a snifter of my favorite bourbon (Basil Hayden). I had noticed he had what looked like shelving tucked into a corner of his den. But, they were weird looking shelves. Asked him about them.

He walked up and pulled them out of the corner. They were these....

https://www.magnepan.com/model_lrs

This is not a well known speaker manufacturer, but are revered to those who know of them.

He said they sounded terrible but was out of the period where he could return them.

These speakers need lots of current to sound good. A $500 AV Receiver won’t cut it. Plus, they send a signal both forward and back. So, they need room to “breathe”. They have to be set up well into the room to sound right. No shoving them against a wall. I’ve not heard the particular speakers this guy had, but have heard numerous Magnepans in the past. They’re unlike anything you’ve ever heard and are glorious when set up correctly. I relayed this information. He said he was “over them” and asked if I would be interested in them.

Magnepans tend to cost on the high side of stereo speakers....$2K to start and go up from there.

He said the ones he has cost $700 and offered them to me for $250 because I was helping him. Great deal....they’re only 6 moths old and were used a handful of times before shoved into a corner.

Downside....these are only good for a two channel system. Even though the cost of entry is cheap, the electronics to drive them would be hefty. Plus, you need room....lots of room. I guess I could convert one of my bedrooms into a listening room. So much for putting my house on the market to downsize.

Not sure I want to go down that road. But, I know what these things sound like. And, they are fantastic in a total sense, not just for the money.

But, I’m finding myself looking at High Current amps and pre-amps that might couple well with them.

We’re back at the install tonight. I’ll have to inspect them more closely.

Sounds to me like this guy was trying to get GG to blow up his hooptie so he could make a claim for damages. He didn’t count on running into a smart cookie like Graphicguy.
Whatever....LOL! It’s not like the oil puddle wasn’t hard to find. Although, I did note he parked the car on blacktop and not his concrete driveway. Harder to see the oil puddle, but it was pretty easy to find one I looked underneath.


I gave the guy the “fam” price since he knew one of my cousins. I charge an hourly or mileage rate. The car’s owner chose the hourly rate (about a 7 hour drive). I explained to him that it’s a crap shoot for hourly as he’d be paying for any traffic jams, weather related delays, etc. No delays? It’ll be less expensive than the hourly rate. But, something goes sideways?

I thought I was doing him a favor, until I did the inspection. I showed him where I thought the oil was coming from....cursory inspection, it looked like the oil pan gasket was the culprit, but who knows?

He wanted a guaranteed hourly charge. I suggested he just pick the mileage rate. Even taking a detour with extra mileage, the mileage rate is going to be fairly easy to plan for. Don’t know why, he didn’t want to do that. In brief, he wanted the cheap rate with me taking the risk of being stranded in his car.

Anyway, I wasn’t going to argue. So, I just thanked him for the opportunity and walked away. That’s about 30 minutes of my life I’d like to have back.

I had an odd thing happen with my HVAC; the indoor coil froze up. It had been replaced under warranty and the system was not low on Freon. I talked with the tech I use and we narrowed the problem down to the Honeywell pleated filter I had just replaced- too restrictive. I switched off the A/C while still running the system’s blower and in a couple of hours the coil was completely thawed out. I replaced the filter with a cheap un-pleated filter and the problem was solved.
I always use the cheap filters for max airflow. I just replace them more often.

Just finished cleaning all the filters at our summer home. These are on the mini split units. I was surprised how much they picked up in a relatively short time. The campground is a little dusty with the crushed shell roads.

""Never let the facts get in the way of a good story.""

I had a case where a a father was fighting with his son over a set of car keys(he thought the son had too much to drink), the father and son both fell on the ground and the father suffered a broken neck and died. It was originally charged(appropriately) as Manslaughter 2nd. My predecessor decided to get some media coverage and re-indicted it as Murder.

When I got the case I reviewed the file; there were three witnesses- the defendant's girlfriend, the father's girlfriend, and a person walking down the sidewalk. The stories differed in substantial respects, so I called the Medical Examiner and asked which description of the event was most likely to have caused the fatal injury. The M.E. said, ""Any of them."" I then pulled up some archived news footage and found a televised interview with the vic's girlfriend(our ""star"" witness) who said, ""I'm sure his son didn't intend to kill him.""- so there went the Murder charge.
I ended up amending it back down to Manslaughter 2nd. On the plea date I spent several minutes explaining on the record the above facts and how they related to my decision to amend the Murder charge. He was sentenced to 10 years, and since he had been in for over 2 years he would already be eligible for parole. No media was present.

3889,Jul-21,ab348,"You guys living in warmer climes with your A/C set to the upper 70s would never last up here. One thing I remember from the late 80s might put it into context. We were in the process of buying a multi-million dollar computer mainframe system (oh how times have changed) to do property assessment valuation province-wide. Given the amount of money involved it was a long and detailed evaluation of the different short-listed options that necessitated site visits. The vendors chose the sites that they thought would show off their system best for us.

One of them was in Volusia County FL, so 3 of us went there, in June. When we stepped off the aircraft it was 95 degrees and 95% humidity. The locals felt it was a bit on the warm side while us Canadians were dying. We checked into our hotel in Orlando and when we went to our rooms all were around 77/78 degrees. This felt unbearably warm to us so unknown to each other we each set our room's A/C to 68. Ahh, relief. Once it settled in at that temp it felt normal to us. The vendor rep (a Florida native) was staying down the hall and rounded us up for dinner, and was astounded at the cool blast he got when each of us opened our room door.

The other thing none of us could get our heads around was that the locals in the office we visited were all wearing white cotton t-shirts under their dress shirts and ties. ""Helps with the perspiration"" they said. Up here you might do that in winter for a bit of extra warmth, but never in summer. But later on we tried it ourselves and it seemed to help, though it felt strange.

That was another twist in the case; the neck injury the M.E. described was a bit unusual; I spent a few hours checking medical journals and that type of injury is virtually never the result of a fight- the cases I found involved falls of over 50', high speed car/motorcycle accidents, and some odd industrial accidents. None of the witnesses in my case described a body slam or tackle; at worst the vic lost his footing and fell with his son falling on top of him.
So if I go to trial the defense will make the M.E.’s COD a major issue, and vic’s girlfriend will be confronted with her statements from the TV interview.
You never know what a jury will do, but I thought that there was a real chance that he might walk.

My assistant has a sex case that we already know is going to crash and burn, but the victim is adamant about going forward. Our own DNA evidence contradicts much of her story; it doesn’t exonerate the defendant but it makes our victim look dishonest at best. All we can do is try it in front of a jury at the end of their term of service- so that the case won’t poison a panel that we will need to try other cases in front of.

It also helped they left a nurse on the jury who had experience with back injuries and the xrays and other scans of them.

3916,Jul-22,dino001,"From complaints all around, including here, it seems old New Hampshire slogan evolved into ""Give me convenience or give me death"". These guys (Walmart, et al) do their best to create environment less conducive to the virus transmission. Some of the ideas may not be wisest, but I think we should stop this constant complaining about rather small inconveniences. Little extra walk never hurt anybody, except perhaps hardest cases of people with bad health conditions, but those should probably get on a scooter.

We are in the middle of raging pandemic and our governments basically left us all to fend for ourselves and many officials keep insisting there is nothing really to worry about, finding ever new excuse for their inaction or sometimes worse - they sabotage each other for political gain. All we are left is business owners trying to figure it out on their own. I'd rather experience small inconvenience here and there imposed on me, if I believe they were done on a good will, than go to places owned by oblivious or uncaring owners. I've seen a lot to be desired, but not in the department of ""oh, it's such a hardship to walk extra couple of hundred yards"", but rather ""why couldn't you put a simple tape across to separate in and out traffic, or make one way aisle signs more conspicuous, or why did you stop disinfecting carts just in time when the spread got worse. These are things worth complaining about in my opinion, not extra yards of a walk.

So my wife wakes up this morning explaining her IPhone 11 Pro Max will not respond to any touch inputs. I do all the normal stuff, hard reboot etc. I then did an ITunes update and then wipe and restore. All fail. It must be a hardware problem.

Luckily we have a spare IPhone my son plays with. Swap SIM cards, factory reset and fresh ICloud sign in. Wife has phone for work.

Now ... try and make appointment with an Apple store. They are all booked until the 31st. Call Apple. On hold forever, so I hung up and attempted to do it online. That worked and it’s under warranty so I just have to drop it off at the UPS store. There is one a few towns south about a 20 minute ride.

I get there and it’s “temporarily closed”. Funny, the website didn’t show that. Now of course the next closet one is 30 miles in the other direction. At least that one was open. For the locals .. this was Sea Isle to Rio Grande all the way back up to Margate. At least I got to see Lucy and three Lambos and two Ferraris.

All this mess for a darn phone. First world problems for sure!

I used to have a great pharmacy/pharmacist, but he retired from the biz and every pharmacy I've dealt with since has been various degrees of awful. None of them big-box either. The one prior to my current one was just terrible. Used them for years and I swear that every single time I went there to pick up a Rx that they called to tell me was ready, they couldn't find it. It was uncanny. Plus they always treated me like I was a first-timer, no recognition that I was the guy who was in there every other week, even when dealing with the same staff person at the counter. Add to that being given someone else's drugs, long waits because everyone ahead of you at the counter was also experiencing problems, being overcharged because their computer system didn't recognize my drug plan, all sorts of snafus. I finally bailed on them a year or so back.

But all pharmacies across Canada got a self-inflicted black eye when COVID hit. Citing concerns over potential drug shortages, they all went to dispensing no more than a 30-day supply starting around the end of March. Now there were no unusual shortages then but OK, I could understand their concern. But that meant a couple of things: they were making people come into the place 3 times as often at a time when people were avoiding such contact. And even better, they were charging the same co-pay/dispensing fee for the 30 day supply that they did for a 90 day supply. So you were now paying that 3 times as much too, with them claiming that they were doing 3 times the work so why not? Well, that was their decision, not the customers, that's why not. But because it was a nationwide decision by their professional association there was no way for a customer to avoid it. It really bought them as a group a lot of ill-will because it seemed like profiteering in a crisis. No shortages ever emerged and the policy was quietly rolled back after 2 or 3 months.

I made the mistake of shopping at Walmart for groceries this morning when senior citizens are allowed to shop early. I got to the Walmart at 7:45 AM this morning and was stopped by the ""entrance guard"" employee and was told that this early time for shopping was for seniors. I said to him, ""...you must be kidding - do I look like I am younger than 55 years old?"" He responded, ""...you have to be 65 years old or older to be admitted early...""! So I again responded, ""...do I look like I am younger than 65 years old?..."" He said that I looked to be around 60 years old. I then took out my driver's license and showed him that I was 75 years old. He apologized and let me into the store.

As I entered, another employee said to me that I was at the wrong entrance to the food area and that I had to go out and go down to the other entrance. So I did as I was told and was again stopped because I looked younger than 65 years old. After again showing my driver's license, I was again admitted to the food shopping area.

I can assure you that I look more like 70 than anyone younger than 70. These people they hire to make sure qualified people are being admitted early need an eye exam before they can be hired. But, I must admit, I sure felt good to be mistaken for someone younger than 65.

My wife is solving that problem personally as her hobby is to wrap all the coins I throw in a jar every night. I cash in at least $100 in coins once a month.

Switching subjects, I was looking at new 2020 Mustang inventory thanks to Ford sending me these “terrific offers” which really amounts to paying sticker price. As I looked at inventory within 100 miles I found this GT 500. Base price $70k, total price $105k with $35k of options.

What options you ask? Well $18k for “carbon fiber track pack”. Yikes! Is a carbon fiber hood, trunk, maybe roof and whatnot worth $18k? I guess so. Also $10k to paint a stripe over the roof. Huh? Then there’s the little things like a $3 grand tech package and $2600 gas guzzler tax. Is this stuff worth it?

3966,Jul-20,omarman,"I've lived here for almost 20 years now and have never seen anybody get out of a car parked on the wrong side of the street, drinking a beer and running from cops. Who does that?

A drunk driver? Drunk driver bailing out of a stolen vehicle?

Just prior to the taser shot, the fleeing suspect is running toward a concrete driveway at right side of screen. There's a person in dark clothes on that driveway quickly moving away from the running suspect.

Friends, Omar welcomes all to my neighborhood so long as you are reasonably sober and not running away from cops in your - or somebody else's - car.

And if you are running away from your troubles do not flee headlong into my neighbors yard where the kids play and parents and grandparents watch over them. That poor running man in the video would be pleading for Police protection if the Grandma who lives in my neighborhood got to him first.

A few years back I saw Grandma clear a group of noisy teenagers out of her front yard with a few strong words, a hard look and a possibly-non-lethal bony index finger. The innocent were scared along with the guilty and they never ticked off Grandma again. And they weren't even joyriding the neighborhood in a stolen van with a beer in their hands! Lol.

After that I respectfully asked another neighbor just who's Grandma is she anyway? I was told ""She's everybody's Grandma."" Fair enough. When the neighborhood doesn't have Everybody's Grandma or something like that then you get the Police.

Oh well, that's the life of an outlaw man. Tough ain't it?

Here at the Snakeweasel lair yesterday I noticed the A/C working harder than usual but the house seemed like it wasn't getting colder. I checked and the house was actually getting warmer and no air was coming out of the registers. Checked out the furnace and yep the blower wasn't working so I surmised that either the. blower motor was shot or the circuit board was. Since this is past my pay grade I called ""the guy"" who came by today.

Well I was right ""the guy"" determined it was a bad circuit board and it needed replacing to the tune of close to a grand. Now since my furnace is old enough to vote and we were planning on replacing it in a few years we decided not to sink any money into it and opted to replace it now. The only issue now is they wont be installing it until late tomorrow afternoon so I have to put up with this oppressive heat for another 15 to 20 hours.

We decided to spend the extra money and get a high efficiency two stage furnace with a variable speed blower.

Believe it or not we are still in the ice age, it's called the Quaternary glaciation and it's been going on for over 2.5 million years. It's the 5th known major ice age the world has known and we are in what's called the interglacial period. It is expected that the glaciers will start to advance in around 50,000 years.

We don't have A/C in our house. We are surrounded by trees and they keep the house about 10 - 15 degrees cooler than outside. We have a few window units in some bedrooms for when it is in the 90's for a few days in a row. When that happens the trees can't keep up and it gets pretty warm inside.

This year it has been hot for a few weeks and warm in the house for a few weeks now as a result.

I called my guy to install A/C. Both furnaces are, fortunately, able to handle adding air. Both were replaced a few years ago.

One furnace is horizontal, but they now make units for that.

I asked about SEER and he said one is 13 and the other is 14. I don't know what brand.

$7,700 installed including 2 new thermostats. That seems reasonable. The roofers should be here soon too. That will be another $12,000. It's a good summer.

The portion dealing with Sweden is particularly relevant, in my opinion.
This is a good example of how facts can be twisted to try and prove your point. Sweden was trying for herd immunity and it was a disaster.....way more deaths per capita than neighboring countries.

Sweden has the largest number of cases and fatalities in Scandinavia—around 37 000 confirmed cases at the time of writing, compared with its neighbours Denmark, Norway, and Finland which have 12 000, 8000, and 7000 cases, respectively. All three neighbouring countries adopted a lockdown approach early in the pandemic, which they are now slowly lifting. All three have since re-opened their borders, but not to Sweden.

Successful countries started early, used masks, and kept distance. Some think immunity only lasts for a few months anyway. And this,
And what of herd immunity? An ongoing nationwide study conducted by the Public Health Agency of Sweden on 20 May found that just 7.3% of Stockholm residents had developed covid-19 antibodies by late April—and that was the largest number of positive results found in the country.

It is possible the virus is so out of control now that the herd immunity theory is the only hope for getting the virus under control.

Sweden has had a high number of deaths but they have not achieved herd immunity. Neither has any area in the United States. Even in hard hit areas only a fraction of the population shows evidence of antibodies. And at the moment we don’t even know if the antibodies confer immunity, or if they do, for how long. There is so much that isn’t known. Right now the best we can do is look to countries that have been successful, like Taiwan.

It had been awhile since I talked to my BMW “guy”, but he called yesterday just to check in. He said business had been challenging, but he’d been at his store for so long, he was one of the sales people who weren’t furloughed. He also said they were slowly bringing back some furloughed people.

I told him I was driving a Stinger. Surprisingly, he said he liked them and that there were some instances people were cross shopping the Stinger at his store.

Anyway, appreciated him reaching out, but not in the market. He said if I changed my mind, there were deals to be had. Not sure why, but he sent this link to me. Looks like a pretty good deal (albeit on a demo)....

I really like the interior.
I decided that for me a G30 540i-even a RWD M Sport-just didn’t excite me all that much. Not a bad car, it just doesn’t give me that “gotta have it” vibe. I think that the G20 3er is a much more involving drive. Right now a RWD 3 Series and a RWD/D-AWD Stinger are the only newer four doors I could see myself owning.

Same thing happened here and in other places. The plastic bag bans were based mostly on emotional pleas by enviro activists that were believed by a large % of the public and which politicians then responded to. This was one unexpected consequence of that. I presume there will be more in the future.

I saw a full color banner advertising the event making the twitter rounds over the last few days and assumed that it was fake news. I won't repost but it was clearly (I thought) satire with the slogans and promise of security provided by private militia and bike groups. Ha. Or not Ha.

But then it really happened. Large group on the Statehouse lawn, carrying signs and flags, speeches, music and of course no masks. I saw a gray hair guy about my age walk past the camera with no mask but holding a large flag and I wondered if he was planning to have it draped over his casket.

Like a lot of boomers I've been a vocal advocate for better health care for the elderly. I've had a few badges of honor rifts with insurance companies and some nurses and doctors over the years. You win some you lose some. And I have been humbled by an occasional call or note from a few health care professionals who have been supportive.

But my generation is losing a lot of credibility in this ""Anti Mask"" behavior. I'm not denying that there were some young (chronologic) adults floating around in that mix at the Statehouse. But others have already posted and re-posted that youth is wasted on the young. How do we make credible arguments about elder care for our generation if we become the gray hair poster face of pandemic denial?

I just read some recent studies which indicates spreading Covid-19 from the elderly to kids may be more likely than we previously thought possible. Still too early to confirm that without more data but why not err on the side of caution until we do know more?

I begrudgingly wear a mask when shopping since I figure what can it hurt but a mask doesn’t protect your eyes which are a major point of infection. Your nose has a line of defense against infectious particles by design. Your eyes, not so much.

I usually end up reseeding patches of lawn every year or two and have always wished I had one of these things. I checked on the retailers website and hey presto, they offer free shipping for online orders! So I ordered the thing and it came the other day. I figure the shipping must have been equal to the price of the thing (the box weighed 30 lbs) or at least their profit margin.

Today I took the box outside to assemble what was inside. What was in there was the roller itself, the user manual, and nothing else. Conspicuous by its absence were anything resembling a handle assembly as illustrated in the manual. A call to their service center got me a recording saying wait times were over an hour and that I should send them a website message instead, so I did.

Are COVID parties happening on the scale or level of organization described in those articles? Most likely not.

Are COVID parties happening? I'm willing to bet they are happening here and there.

Are COVID parties efficiently spreading the virus? We'll never know.

Then again, this morning my running partner was telling me about the ""celebration of the return to normal"" at her office this week, and it sure sounded like a COVID party. Decorations, lots of communal food, and encouraged mingling among co-workers.

Like many others I have been doing a lot more online ordering during the pandemic. 10 days ago I saw an item that I couldn't pass up on sale but the local store was out of stock - a lawn roller. I usually end up reseeding patches of lawn every year or two and have always wished I had one of these things. I checked on the retailers website and hey presto, they offer free shipping for online orders! So I ordered the thing and it came the other day. I figure the shipping must have been equal to the price of the thing (the box weighed 30 lbs) or at least their profit margin.

Today I took the box outside to assemble what was inside. What was in there was the roller itself, the user manual, and nothing else. Conspicuous by its absence were anything resembling a handle assembly as illustrated in the manual. A call to their service center got me a recording saying wait times were over an hour and that I should send them a website message instead, so I did. Will be interesting to see what kind of response I get.
Oh! You wanted a handle too? That'll be an extra cost.

When I posted about Covid parties one of our smarter members found evidence that the story was bogus. Yet I still hear the Covid party story bandied about on the national news. Makes it hard to believe anything.
The whole thing has been politicized from the beginning. Even trying to command that others have to wear masks has been a political tool for many.

Myself, even though the science study I believe says the most effective masks are not stopping viruses at a majority rate and that the weakest cloth masks are really poor at that duty, I wear my doctor office type mask. Just makes sense for me at my age and with some minor factors.

As for the younger folks who are affected at a really low rate, much less than the flu season we just went through here, let the herd immunity work--it's worked in other countries with outcomes about the same as ours here. The peaks the media screams about are due to the rioting spreading the viruses and mobility across the southern borders at holidays.


For those wearing same mask over and over, there's a danger of infectious things building up. A doctor had his wife get legionnaires disease from wearing masks. I hang mine in the direct ultraviolet of the sunshine outside my cars to dry and sterilize the several different ones I have in the cars.

I agree with you about Primantis. I’m not saying it’s bad, just can’t understand all the hoopla. There is a local franchise in my hood and on the few occasions when I have gone there the people have been just great, wish I liked the sandwich as much as the people who run the place. And about fries on their sandwich, who the hell thought that up? I always have the fries removed from the sandwich and served on the side as they should be. Same goes for fries on a salad, that idea must have come from the same brainchild.

The problem is that the younger ones then bring it home to mom, dad, and grandparents. For there to be herd immunity there will have to be a lot more dead people, and I don’t think that’s what we want. Other countries have shown us how to get control of the virus. We just seem unable to do what it takes.

Difference in intent between a Covid party where getting the virus is seen as sport and just a party where kids are sick of sitting home.

We don't have A/C in our house. We are surrounded by trees and they keep the house about 10 - 15 degrees cooler than outside. We have a few window units in some bedrooms for when it is in the 90's for a few days in a row. When that happens the trees can't keep up and it gets pretty warm inside.

This year it has been hot for a few weeks and warm in the house for a few weeks now as a result.

I called my guy to install A/C. Both furnaces are, fortunately, able to handle adding air. Both were replaced a few years ago.

One furnace is horizontal, but they now make units for that.

I asked about SEER and he said one is 13 and the other is 14. I don't know what brand.

$7,700 installed including 2 new thermostats. That seems reasonable. The roofers should be here soon too. That will be another $12,000. It's a good summer.

my daughter recently moved to an apartment in a trendy neighborhood in Wilmington (DE). quiet street, some twins some rows. Parking of course is often street in those places. But, she is across from a fire house dating to something like 1890 or 1912. Real old! no longer in use, so a big place with lots of parking lot. Turns out it sold a while back to a local doctor who is planning to rehab it into living upstairs, and downstairs in the truck room will be where he keeps his car collection.

Is Taylor Ham the same a Pork Roll? The guy who owns the local bagel shop is from Northern Jersey. He has Jersey specialties and apparently it's hard to find Taylor Ham in Vermont, but he has it.
ps. I've heard of a hoagie, but it's usually said with a certain accent:)
Yes it is the same. Taylor is the original and there are several other manufacturers. Even our local supermarket chain has a house brand.

As most of you know, I did take a look at a Veloster N; late last year my son and I went to look at one at Oxmoor(ons) Hyundai. I'm still on their prospects list and yesterday they sent me a notice that they had a Veloster N in stock. Their advertised price is $5,000 over the MSRP of $30,745. Just for fun I asked why they were asking $5,000 over sticker. Their response?
""With the current market, the demand is high and the supply is low.""

Nice try, but another Louisville Hyundai dealer has an essentially identical Veloster N advertised for $1,444 under sticker- and there are 9 more with the essential Performance Package for sale within a 100 mile radius.
It's reassuring to know that some things-like the Oxmoor(ons) dealer group-never change...

I lived in NY City for 22 years and frequented the Hudson River Valley many times, but I never heard the word ""grinder"" referred to as a sandwich. Hero or Sub were the names of sandwiches we would buy at the German Deli for lunch hour when we were in Junior High.

When I moved to the Chicago area in 1966, Coke and Pepsi along with any other drink that was carbonated were called ""pop""! Soda was a word reserved for ""ice cream sodas""! I lived in the Chicago area for 23 years and was never able to call a carbonated drink ""pop""! They were always sodas to me. But my wife and kids called them ""pops""! I was surrounded by midwesterners who used a foreign language around me. But I did lose my NY accent and acquired a midwestern twang after 4-5 years.

I learned that Chicagoans had a word ""phosphate"" which referred to a chocolate soda with or without milk in it. We New Yorkers called them ""egg-creams""!

When I meet people for the first time, they always ask me if I am a Midwesterner - they never take me for a New Yorker.🤓🤪😜🤓

I was reading a review about the Tesla 3 in todays Wheels.ca section of the newspaper. They praise the car in a lot of ways this being part of the praise:

On the road, the Model 3 SR+ is smooth, quick, and surprisingly analog. Acceleration is effortless, while the car’s default regenerative braking creates the right amount of resistance for urban driving.

Where the SR+ really stomps its competition is in the way it tackles a corner. The steering is ultra precise and the car responds immediately to the slightest inputs. Give it too much throttle upon corner exit, and yes, it’ll kick out the rear the way a BMW 3-Series would, but allows you to correct its trajectory with the slightest steering inputs. It’s all executed with the utmost accuracy, enhancing the car’s driving excitement.

The 2020 Tesla Model SR+ was proving to be a much more compelling machine than we originally expected. Furthermore, we were having just as much fun driving this laptop on wheels than many gasoline-fed contraptions currently on sale. It’s a truly fantastic automobile this one.

But, then, the problems started creeping in.
These were some negatives!

At freeway speeds we heard infuriatingly loud wind noise coming from the driver’s side window. It was so bad that we had to check twice if the window was correctly fitted inside its slot.

Then, it was the car’s centre console; that large slab of cheap plastic that occupies the entire cabin’s midsection. It just wouldn’t stop cracking as the car drove over the slightest road imperfections. And don’t get us started about how flimsy the Model 3’s entire structure feels over uneven tarmac. Is this supposed to be a $53,000 luxury sedan? It sure doesn’t feel like one.

At this point it’s important to mention that Tesla doesn’t have press units for journalists to review, which forced us to turn to the Turo car sharing service. Through a mobile app, the service allows you to rent someone’s vehicle for an entire day, or even a weekend. Because this bargain basement 2020 Model 3 2020 SR+ only had 6,000 km on tap, we felt it was fitting for our test.

The cabin issues could have been forgiven considering Tesla isn’t yet a big player in this game. Indeed, kudos goes to this California-based startup for manufacturing a device so technologically advanced that it instantly makes you wonder why big-name brands haven’t gotten there first.

Unfortunately, our issues with the car didn’t stop there. Once parked at the Tesla Supercharger to juice up our battery, we took the time to properly observe our example’s build quality. We weren’t entirely surprised to notice the wrap that was protecting its body, as the Model 3 is notorious for its bad paint quality that peels off the rocker panels after a few Canadian winters.

Tesla still doesn’t offer a solution for this by the way, leaving many owners stranded with a car that’s shedding its own skin. A wrap, or, in some cases, mudguards, seem to be the best fix owners have come up with.

What we weren’t expecting were the immense panel gaps and uneven assembly on each side of the car. We spotted a rear driver side door that didn’t properly align with the body, and rubber moldings of uneven thickness around the car’s openings.

Then, another Model 3 owner pulled up next to us, and his situation was even worse than ours.

Christophe Murphy has had his Model 3 SR+ for less than a week, and he’s not a happy camper. For starters, he purchased his SR+ before June 30th, which, according to Tesla, would grant him access to free Supercharging for the first year of ownership. Yet, his car isn’t equipped with the feature. All attempts to contact Tesla on his part about this have so far failed.

Murphy then showed us his car’s build quality, which wasn’t any better than ours. We spotted an uneven passenger-side C-pillar, a driver-side mirror that doesn’t properly align with the front fender and A-pillar, and a rear door that doesn’t operate the way it should due to the way it has been fitted.

Christophe then carried on telling us that his grandfather also owns a Model 3, which is also a victim of bad paint. Within 24 hours, we had spotted three examples. And all of them had serious issues.

This brings us to the following question: if these manufacturing flaws would have appeared on any other car, would you be so forgiving? We wouldn’t, which is why although we have tremendous respect for everything that comes out of Tesla’s Fremont plant in California, and admire how the brand has reshaped the automotive landscape, we simply can’t excuse pitfalls such as these, especially in a car that’s supposedly aimed at the middle class.

I couldn't take the plunge and by one at this time.
That one long post should count as 10. Don't let them cheat you.

the top map is very true. I grew up just north of NYC (other side of the river from Sandy). I could see the skyline from a tree in our yard (before other trees grew too tall). maybe 15 miles. Yet, the ""city people"" considered that ""upstate"". They were nuts. Though I still consider the capital district upstate. Mainly because once you get much north of Saratoga, it is pretty much wilderness until you hit Canada!

In Jersey, the natives seem to be very touchy about the Central concept. Many swear there is only north and south (but don't always agree where the line is) and will fight the sect that believes there is a central (I happen to think there definitely is). Battle lines tend to be drawn along the Taylor ham vs. Pork rule divide.

Do AWD systems come with limited slip differentials? I had lots of fun in the snow with plain old RWD limited slip. It must be a hoot with AWD.
Haven’t experienced snow or ice with the Stinger yet (matter of fact, I can’t recall getting anything that stuck to the ground in the OH Valley last Winter). But, I did experience some of it with my TLX.

The limits of the tires are more the issue than the car’s behavior. It automatically (and instantaneously) shifted torque to the corner(s) of the car from the wheels that were slipping to those that weren’t....until the wheel’s slipping subsided. The result was being able to traverse very slippery roads without much drama.

In the dry is where the LSD really shined. The TLX cornered like it was a much lighter, much smaller car as a result.

The Stinger is much the same. I have yet to find a speed that scares me in the Stinger. That said, it has summer rubber on it. This winter, I’m going to have to invest in some cold weather rubber when the weather turns. I’m sure that will affect handling (and not in a good way).

2020 Acura RDX tech SH-AWD"
4136,Jul-17,roadburner,"Some people believe that a traction control system is as good as a limited slip diff- but it most definitely is not from a performance standpoint. For example, if a wheel spins the traction control brakes the spinning wheel- which with an open diff has the effect of vectoring torque to the other wheel- and unless you are Erik Carlsson and rallying a Saab you do NOT want the brakes applied when you are trying to accelerate. If braking the spinning wheel doesn’t work the traction control system dials back the power, which is also a less than optimum solution.
I do think that AWD is more of a help than a hindrance as a vehicle’s hp approaches 600. As I mentioned earlier, the current M5 and E63 S are AWD but do allow the driver to adjust the torque distribution- so in those particular cases I wouldn’t mind owning a true performance car with four driven wheels.

I vote for poor driving.
Maybe it is more than just poor driving. Most of these incidents seem to happen a lot to Mustangs. Some, not all, Mustang drivers buy a Mustang because they want a car that is fast and sporty. But, these guys don't know there own limits, and they don't realize the car has limits too.

Remember the Dunning-Kruger Effect, it is the tendency for people to misjudge their abilities. People with less than average abilities tend to overestimate their true abilities, while those with higher than average abilities tend to not realize how much better they are. These guys have a little bit of knowledge and dream big, and they think because they drive a Mustang they have more driving ability than they really have.

Of course none of this applies to oldfarmer who has good old common sense.

That’s the main house roof peaking up in the distance. Lol. We technically have 3 separate roofs: the garage, the “breezeway,” the house, and the .... I don’t know WTH it is... sometimes called Solarium, I think? It is an extra room off the ground floor at the back of the house. Lots of windows. We call it “the piano room” because a piano was there when we moved in and will likely be there if/when we move out.

4161,Jul-17,driver100,"I was reading a review about the Tesla 3 in todays Wheels.ca section of the newspaper. They praise the car in a lot of ways this being part of the praise:

On the road, the Model 3 SR+ is smooth, quick, and surprisingly analog. Acceleration is effortless, while the car’s default regenerative braking creates the right amount of resistance for urban driving.

Where the SR+ really stomps its competition is in the way it tackles a corner. The steering is ultra precise and the car responds immediately to the slightest inputs. Give it too much throttle upon corner exit, and yes, it’ll kick out the rear the way a BMW 3-Series would, but allows you to correct its trajectory with the slightest steering inputs. It’s all executed with the utmost accuracy, enhancing the car’s driving excitement.

The 2020 Tesla Model SR+ was proving to be a much more compelling machine than we originally expected. Furthermore, we were having just as much fun driving this laptop on wheels than many gasoline-fed contraptions currently on sale. It’s a truly fantastic automobile this one.

But, then, the problems started creeping in.
These were some negatives!

At freeway speeds we heard infuriatingly loud wind noise coming from the driver’s side window. It was so bad that we had to check twice if the window was correctly fitted inside its slot.

Then, it was the car’s centre console; that large slab of cheap plastic that occupies the entire cabin’s midsection. It just wouldn’t stop cracking as the car drove over the slightest road imperfections. And don’t get us started about how flimsy the Model 3’s entire structure feels over uneven tarmac. Is this supposed to be a $53,000 luxury sedan? It sure doesn’t feel like one.

At this point it’s important to mention that Tesla doesn’t have press units for journalists to review, which forced us to turn to the Turo car sharing service. Through a mobile app, the service allows you to rent someone’s vehicle for an entire day, or even a weekend. Because this bargain basement 2020 Model 3 2020 SR+ only had 6,000 km on tap, we felt it was fitting for our test.

The cabin issues could have been forgiven considering Tesla isn’t yet a big player in this game. Indeed, kudos goes to this California-based startup for manufacturing a device so technologically advanced that it instantly makes you wonder why big-name brands haven’t gotten there first.

Unfortunately, our issues with the car didn’t stop there. Once parked at the Tesla Supercharger to juice up our battery, we took the time to properly observe our example’s build quality. We weren’t entirely surprised to notice the wrap that was protecting its body, as the Model 3 is notorious for its bad paint quality that peels off the rocker panels after a few Canadian winters.

Tesla still doesn’t offer a solution for this by the way, leaving many owners stranded with a car that’s shedding its own skin. A wrap, or, in some cases, mudguards, seem to be the best fix owners have come up with.

What we weren’t expecting were the immense panel gaps and uneven assembly on each side of the car. We spotted a rear driver side door that didn’t properly align with the body, and rubber moldings of uneven thickness around the car’s openings.

Then, another Model 3 owner pulled up next to us, and his situation was even worse than ours.

Christophe Murphy has had his Model 3 SR+ for less than a week, and he’s not a happy camper. For starters, he purchased his SR+ before June 30th, which, according to Tesla, would grant him access to free Supercharging for the first year of ownership. Yet, his car isn’t equipped with the feature. All attempts to contact Tesla on his part about this have so far failed.

Murphy then showed us his car’s build quality, which wasn’t any better than ours. We spotted an uneven passenger-side C-pillar, a driver-side mirror that doesn’t properly align with the front fender and A-pillar, and a rear door that doesn’t operate the way it should due to the way it has been fitted.

Christophe then carried on telling us that his grandfather also owns a Model 3, which is also a victim of bad paint. Within 24 hours, we had spotted three examples. And all of them had serious issues.

This brings us to the following question: if these manufacturing flaws would have appeared on any other car, would you be so forgiving? We wouldn’t, which is why although we have tremendous respect for everything that comes out of Tesla’s Fremont plant in California, and admire how the brand has reshaped the automotive landscape, we simply can’t excuse pitfalls such as these, especially in a car that’s supposedly aimed at the middle class.

I couldn't take the plunge and by one at this time.

Some people believe that a traction control system is as good as a limited slip diff- but it most definitely is not from a performance standpoint. For example, if a wheel spins the traction control brakes the spinning wheel- which with an open diff has the effect of vectoring torque to the other wheel- and unless you are Erik Carlsson and rallying a Saab you do NOT want the brakes applied when you are trying to accelerate. If braking the spinning wheel doesn’t work the traction control system dials back the power, which is also a less than optimum solution.
I do think that AWD is more of a help than a hindrance as a vehicle’s hp approaches 600. As I mentioned earlier, the current M5 and E63 S are AWD but do allow the driver to adjust the torque distribution- so in those particular cases I wouldn’t mind owning a true performance car with four driven wheels.
In the Mustang I don’t have any sensation of brakes being applied when I accelerate but if I turn off the traction control I’d be spinning the wheels every time I moved. It still allows for some spirited driving...I inadvertently did a power slide through a rotary once in the rain without it intervening.

But from some of those videos I wonder if some people don’t know how to use brakes or the steering wheel.

As someone who has worked on fundraising drives for nonprofits, I can tell you that matching is a powerful incentive for a lot of donors. If you think, if I give $50, they will match, then it’s like doubling your donation. It’s also a good way to honor larger donors during the drive.

Re browsers — is anyone even updating Firefox any more? I’d imagine it has a lot of glitches. Chrome is pretty standard, is updated often, and works well for most people, as does Safari.
Firefox does *weekly* updates. I presume most of them are security-related but I notice they have added a bunch of functions I will never use. Perhaps that is what makes it flaky on this site.

I don't like Chrome (aside from being a Google product) because unless I've missed something, it has the typical Google minimalist interface. Whenever I use it I feel like I'm in the dark. At least Firefox gives you every possible choice in menus, if that's what you want. I find Safari (which I've only ever used on my Apple devices) even more inscrutable. Maybe I'll try this Brave thing.

Totally out of left field, I have a gripe....a minor one, but something that’s bothered me for a long while.

I don’t donate to any political campaign. Matter of fact, the only monetary charitable donations I make are to a few research arms of non-profits. I don’t even donate to my church (much to their chagrin). If they can’t find enough money to operate with all the priceless artifacts sitting in the Vatican, then that’s on them.

As I’m sure most of you here in the U.S. have noted, political campaigns are furiously bombarding us, asking for donations. Most say that if I donate a certain amount, it will be matched by someone else or some sort of other entity. Matched? Why do you need our money in order to get someone else’s money? Why doesn’t the entity just donate the money to begin with? Seems really silly, to me.

I notice my local public radio station does the same thing.

All of them predict some sort of catastrophe if I don’t donate. Let the chaos begin, then.

The new tact of those super irritating “extended warranty” robocalls is to ask you to confirm you want to be put on their “do not call” list. All that does is tell them you’re a live number that they can increase their calls.

There...I feel better.

Can you tell I have more time on my hands these days?
Well, I can tell you that if you make a donation to ME it will be matched by the next sucker I can scam. Guaranteed. 🤑

Regarding the teaching gig - they aren't doing distance learning? My wife teaches an early childhood class each semester, totally online.
They plan on doing virtual learning. Those plans are still being fleshed out, though. Nothing's cut in stone. I suspect there won't be something concrete until next month. I know on my end, we've tested ZOOM for classroom work and it seemed to go off without a hitch. But, you add in a dozen or 15 students online, and it's unclear what the ""gotchas"" will be.

We'll get there. We're just not there, yet!

Nope; it's AWD with no driver selectable torque split or rear LSD. That's the only way I'll buy an AWD car- and still, I'd rather have a RWD car.

RB...I doubt it's what you're looking for. I think you're looking for a mechanical LSD.

My AWD has it, but it's electronic and uses the brakes to channel power to different drive wheels. The % of shift is not driver controllable, either. GTS has mechanical LSD available, as does the RWD version.

My TLX had mechanical LSD.

Is there a difference? The way I drive? Not so much. But, if you're regularly flogging the car in turns or auto-X, then yes, there would be a noticeable difference.

You are absolutely right; I should have clarified my comment. A pure mechanical LSD is good enough for me, although some cars-like the true BMW ///M cars have a mechanical LSD where the clutch packs are controlled electronically. The 440i manual coupe I found was AWD, but I fully intended to install the M Performance locking diff as soon as I drove it home. Plus, it had the Track Handling Package and the M Performance power and Sound Kit- so I thought the AWD experience would be tolerable.

I want to be able to adjust understeer or oversteer by using the throttle and steering wheel; that's almost impossible to do when the AWD system is deciding which end of the car gets more power. And on top of that most stability control systems are primarily designed to protect the grossly inept-and sadly all too typical-American vehicle operator(""driver"" is far too generous a term). At least most performance cars allow you to dial the nannies back or-better yet-disable them entirely.
That's the primary reason that my Club Sport, despite being glacially slow. is such a joy to drive down a twisting two lane or road course- the steering and suspension let the driver know exactly what is going on at all four contact patches. If a driver fails to pay attention he/she will pay the consequences- no nanny will protect the fool from his own ineptitude. Even better was my 2002; it had steering so communicative that you actually could feel a difference between driving on asphalt or concrete road surfaces.

If you want to confuse someone from NYC just ask them where is upstate.



the top map is very true. I grew up just north of NYC (other side of the river from Sandy). I could see the skyline from a tree in our yard (before other trees grew too tall). maybe 15 miles. Yet, the ""city people"" considered that ""upstate"". They were nuts. Though I still consider the capital district upstate. Mainly because once you get much north of Saratoga, it is pretty much wilderness until you hit Canada!

Some do, sure. Some with none, some with LSD rear only, and some with LSD front and back. IIRC, the STi has (or at least HAD) 3 LSDs in it: one on each axle and one in the center. AND it has/had dials for you to control the power distribution. I wanted one just for that.

Some do; the Stinger GTS and Indigo Editions have them, and the front/rear torque split can be adjusted from 40/60 to 20/80 to 0/100(AKA ""Drift Mode""). The M5 and the E63 S are the only other AWD sedans that have that capability. The WRX STI also allows some adjustment of the F/R torque split as well.
Some of the newer BMW M and M Performance xDrive vehicles also have a mechanical LSD.
That's the extent of my knowledge on the subject, which as you can see isn't much.

4241,Jul-16,imidazol97,"I would suggest adding some duct tape. Or buffing the software some more. All in jest. But I won't because
I'd be afraid I'd get scolded for my sense of humor.

Actually, this forum software NOW in place works most of the time better than some of its predecessors have worked. I don't remember any outages for parts of days and more as I recall in the past.

It is my thinking that some of the sticking points are caused by individual browsers as they as configured on a particular user's computer. That often involves other pieces of software (apps) that do things that end up interfering with another app's hook into the browser or its addons.

I also found cleaning my computer of all adware and maleware items, and a complete restart, helped fix problems.

I use 3 browsers:
Brave, which is great, but blocks trackers and ads, meaning no revenue for showing me that ad about the Ego hedge trimmer I browsed yesterday to buy for my son and DIL to trim their shrubs. I don't use Brave on Edmunds so that the ads get shown.

Chrome, which loads all these trackers and ads, and stores everything about me including things that Alphabet and friends say they don't store, and sends it to the mothership.

And Firefox, which I use occasionally, but seems to always have an update version it needs to spend 5 minutes finishing downloading or installing before the browser can finally open. But Firefox seems to have the least problems. It also is most capable with add on's to capture videos that Chrome keeps from being captured because of their YouTube ownership and protecting YouTube.

I have Google as a search engine, but it prevents showing some items and pushes other items as part of the goals of the company. So I usually go to duckduckgo.com. I should set it as my preferred browser.

That duckduckgo has no connection with duct tape.

I notice the license plate frame: Cars like eggs are cheaper in the country.

Is that still the motto at Jeff Wyler? It was when I lived half a mile from his one Chevy store in Union Twp.
Thanks! I don’t think Wyler uses that slogan anymore, but I do remember it. He has so many dealerships now, and his original dealership really was in the country (which is now all developed), I don’t think the slogan fits any more.

4250,Jul-16,abacomike,"My beef, since we are seem to be letting it all hang out, is the pharmaceutical commercials on TV. Over the past several months, these ads have seemed to quadruple in number. Ads for drugs for diabetes, Crones disease, arthritis, breast cancer, lung cancer, constipation, sleep disorders, prevention of dementia, hearing aids, glasses, migraines, muscle cramps, diet plans, Hepatitis C, AIDS prevention, toenail fungus, eczema, psoriasis, menstrual cramps, etc., have been bombarding us every time we turn on the TV. Then, Medicare Plans hit us left and right.

My take on this bombardment has to do with pharmaceuticals taking up the ad space on TV programming that was once bought up by department stores and shopping malls. I can't remember the last time I saw a Macys or Kohl's add on TV or even in the newspaper.

But those drug ads are monopolizing TV ad spots to an exorbitant level.

I have used Firefox since it was Netscape, so a long time. As such I am loathe to change. But on this site (and a few others) it misbehaves now. For example, it will usually not allow the pull-downs for pics, emojis, links, etc to work when composing a post. When the stars align on a certain date of a certain month without a ""R"" in its name it might, but usually not. And then you have the constant updates which are a pain.

Chrome always* lets me use those pull-downs. But I dislike using Chrome.

In limited use so far I've found MS Edge to work better than either, but I really don't like MS, so I'm torn.

Changing store choices doesn't always work well. E.g., Walmart insists I want to have things delivered to southern Ohio, when all I want to do is browse for an item or price in the location stores.

As someone who has worked on fundraising drives for nonprofits, I can tell you that matching is a powerful incentive for a lot of donors. If you think, if I give $50, they will match, then it’s like doubling your donation. It’s also a good way to honor larger donors during the drive. I’m not sure why it should bother anyone. If you don’t want to donate, unsubscribe from the email list.
Re browsers — is anyone even updating Firefox any more? I’d imagine it has a lot of glitches. Chrome is pretty standard, is updated often, and works well for most people, as does Safari.

If you recall the events of a year or two back when someone decided the login function, which had worked seamlessly for years and years, needed to be fixed, and the resultant debacle that led to people locked out and forced to use new made-up names and email addresses, be grateful that you escaped from the system's clutches in the nick of time.

Remember, that function was likely designed and programmed by the same group that fixed the picture-posting function in such a way that many people simply cannot use it. And while we're at it, cast your mind back to the few days that the ""rich editor"" was foisted on us as the solution to all the board's problems.

I've been getting one about every three months. Starts wearing off after 9-10 weeks. But, it isn't really a good long-term strategy for me. The knee is pretty unstable, even when they get the swelling/pain to go away. Going in for an MRI, tomorrow. But, arthroscopic surgery is the best guess.. meniscus tear.

I agree, though. The injection is nearly painless, these days.

My wife had the knee surgery.

Cost us in excess of $300,000 - we moved from a 2-story to a ranch level house to accommodate her mobility.

Fortunately, the surgery seems to have worked - she's only had moderate discomfort since then, and she's spending 8-10 hours a day on her feet at the studio this summer.

Not at all. The name is from that of the famous racing schooner ""Bluenose"" of the 1920s and '30s. An image of it appears on the Canadian dime coin. The original was lost in the 1940s, then a local brewery (which brewed a then-popular beer named ""Schooner"") built a replica for promotional purposes in the mid-1960s. They donated it to the provincial govt in the early 1970s who used it to promote tourism and other purposes, like sailing around visiting VIPs. I remember walking past its berth on the downtown Halifax waterfront on a sunny summer Friday afternoon in the early '80s and seeing the then-Minister of Economic Development (the dept in charge of it at the time) sitting shirtless in a chair on the deck, drinking.

For a couple of years I worked for the provincial Tourism dept and that file crossed my desk. When the brewery had it built they were not concerned with long-term durability, and when it passed into the hands of the province nobody knew how to maintain it, so it began having problems. After a few very expensive refits to cure massive rot it was decommissioned several years ago and a new replica was built, at huge expense and with numerous debacles during the build, since those within govt who were in charge knew nothing about building ships, especially wooden ships. It finally was completed a few years ago and has completely fallen off the radar since. I forget the final cost but I am pretty sure it was well in excess of $20 million.

He’s had his wife in a few of his videos. He’d be a fool to do anything to jeopardize that.

Again, going by his videos, when he sells a loss leader, he tells the customer the vehicle will probably need work, and may not pass state inspection in Delaware. I would think he has them sign a paper stating they are buying something that has no warranty, implied or otherwise. Be tough sledding in court if the buyer claimed his/her 200K mile car should operate perfectly.

@kyfdx....had my Bengals season tix until 2015. Almost an entirely new team now. Should be interesting.

Side note, I’ve been visiting local new car dealers dropping off my business cards as another transporter resource. Funny, the dealer I buy all my Acuras from called mid-morning stating they needed a transport to their Dayton OH dealership to complete a deal....NOW! I got to the dealership in ½ hour. Got it to the Dayton dealer early afternoon. I transported at new RDX. What a nice SUV...relatively quick comparatively, nicely loaded (man, the ELS stereo in that thing is AMAZING).

Guy who came out to inspect the RDX when I parked it, had just finished F&I and wanted to inspect the new RDX. I told him I drove it UNDER the speed limit. He pulled his trade next to the RDX to put his personal belongings in it. He traded a Lincoln MKX...funny, as he had an S-Type badge glued to the back. Wish I took a picture.

Drove an ILX back. I was surprised how nice that car is. If they dropped the Honda 2.0 turbo in that thing, it was be a runaway hit.

Well if a car doesn't run there is no need for a safety inspection as it wont be on the road. As for shifting electric cars dont shift so you have that.

Back in the '90s, Cincinnati and the County it sits in had yearly testing to get a tag. It was run by a 3rd party (IIRC). Pretty Micky Mouse operation. I think it was just a visual look at tail pipe emissions test. Lots of graft and corruption with the whole process, from the County to the company who did the tests. They finally shut them all down under the guise of getting air quality to acceptable levels.

What they didn't say was the drop in emissions was because of more stringent CAFE and emissions standards by the Fed. Older cars, those that would pollute the worst, were exempt given their age.

According to NH BMV, even if your car has a ""check engine"" light on, or a cracked windshield, etc, it won't pass inspections. That ""check engine"" is the killer, as that could be anything from a loose gas cap, to a bad mass air sensor, to bad fuel injectors, etc.

Echeck.

Still operates in the NE portion of the State of Ohio (Cleveland area).

I believe as various areas of the State of Ohio met air pollution standards set by who knows
who for a reqiured minimum number of days of the year, they were relieved of the corruption penalty of having to
take their cars in for a plug and play. I see now they don't even stick a sniffer in the
exhaust pipe. They just plug into the onboard computer.

She said she could do them at her office and phoned in a prescription for me to pick up on my way there today.

I think the point he's making is that for the 99% of drivers they aren't going to notice or care about such things. The desire to have an open roof experience at their convenience outweighs such cons.
If car companies like BMW cared, they wouldn’t keep piling on pounds to there cars. And making 5,000# CUVs.

In street driving a moonroof (or front license plate!) is insignificant dynamically. Probably more of an issue is all the overweight people in this country. Get everyone on a diet, and you can keep your moonroof.

Front plates? There are actual reasons they had 2. If nothing else, so traffic cops could see them when cars parked nose in. Must make traffic cams easier too (stuff like EZ pass). I’m surprised more states don’t change though. Can charge the same registration fee, for half the plates.

It actually is possible. You create two entities under one umbrella - one operational (leases the vehicles) and one financial (acts as a lessor). This way you keep two things separate in terms of financial performance. I don't know if that was the case for Hertz. Also, Hertz might have bought part of its fleet and leased from outside another part.
Enterprise has what they call “buy backs” in it’s fleet which are essentially leases from the manufacturer. After a predetermined mileage they are returned to the company. Enterprise also leases most if not all of it’s facilities.

I think he’s pretty straight up, too. He makes no bones that he’s NOT a BHPH lot. A lot of what he carries seems to be stock a BHPH lot would have on hand, though.....100K+ miles....minivans, SUVs, Altimas, etc. On occasion, he will go off the same script and buy a “vette” or exotic. Plus, he does love well usedEscalades, too.

Saw one of his videos where he uses a loss leader....an $1,800 car with 200K miles. Once the potential customer gets to the lot to see it, they decide they want something better. He makes it a point stating that he can get them in a $2,500 car, lower mileage, better condition, etc. if the customer can come up with a little more cash. Or, he’ll get them financed (he doesn’t carry his own accounts) with their downpayment for something much nicer.

Give him credit. He said he started with nothing, turning one “flip” into 2, 2 into 4, 4 into 8, etc.

He doesn't run a ""Mouse House"" but he does try to get credit challenged customers car loans and on one of his videos he talks about what a PITA it is to do this. Our store was in an upscale area so we didn't get many like that. We did get fooled once in awhile but we didn't deal with sub prime lenders.

She said she could do them at her office and phoned in a prescription for me to pick up on my way there today.

Generally it’s okay to use a term like that if you’re from that group, because then you own it and it’s not a slur. That’s how Foxworthy uses it. If you’re not, best to avoid. Then you’re tarring someone with a well known put down. As a Jew, we have lots of in jokes amongst ourselves that would be highly Offensive if outsiders said them. This should not be a hard concept to grasp.
Great explanation.......but, I don't think Foxworthy really grew up as a redneck.
Early Life
Comedian, radio personality and talk show host Jeffrey Marshall Foxworthy was born on September 6, 1958, in Atlanta, Georgia. Foxworthy himself is from the South, but his father was a computer executive at IBM, and the family lived in the suburb of Hapeville, Georgia. Foxworthy claims that although his father had a high-level professional job, he displayed many of the traits Foxworthy would later describe as being ""redneck.""

But, he did develop his act around what he saw and the people he observed.
Maybe part of the reason he gets away with it is it is so over the top, you know it is exaggerated.

Those things dont turn or stop on a dime. The red ship is sitting high in the water (carrying a very light load) so it has a a greater chance of getting damage below the waterline. It's not so much as the amount of damage but the location, remember the Titanic had a relatively small gash from that iceberg.

The fastest way to stop a ship is to put the engines in full reverse, only takes a second. Many ships can be stopped from full speed in two ship lengths, but considering the lengths of ships that's a long distance.

Looks like the Florence Spirit crossed in front of the other ship. Ships typically pass port to port. It sounds like there are five horn blasts from someone signaling danger but it doesn't sound loud enough, could just be bad sound on the video.

I disagree with the author’s clickbait premise that greed caused the collapse. A few dozens of millions spread around the upper management was a drop in the bucket compared to $20 billion in debt. What was the alternative, let all your executives jump ship and leave the company in turmoil. Like it or not $10-20 million in compensation for a CEO is routine these days. If they had turned things around they would have been heroes.
The ""greed"" portion was mostly outrageous $1B dividend (paid from debt) after the buyout, it crippled the company before it could start working on its improvement. Upper management's pay is just a small part that facilitates these moves. Icahn's practice of gutting company's assets didn't help either. That guy was never into any kind of business, all he does is make those ""metric-based"" improvements that result in larger fragility of a company and it almost always ends in tears, usually after he sells (this time he just was caught before he could sell).

Overleveraging is common practice in business, usually happens in good times, when all investors ask for is another dollar of earnings, even if it comes at cost of increased risk. There is ""Efficient capital"" paradigm in large corporations, which are run by people who focus on current financial metrics above everything else. It's basically mortal sin to keep any money on the books for exogenous events, because it messes up with those metrics (larger hard assets or cash mean higher denominator in many of those ""return"" metrics, i.e. lower nominal performance). Even though we have something big happening pretty much every ten years, every time it happens executives act like ""who knew things will get hard again"".

It actually is possible. You create two entities under one umbrella - one operational (leases the vehicles) and one financial (acts as a lessor). This way you keep two things separate in terms of financial performance. I don't know if that was the case for Hertz. Also, Hertz might have bought part of its fleet and leased from outside another part.

I agree - there is no personal service worth 60 million dollars per year, period. One can make as much in investments, as the risk will be commensurate, but in terms of employment services, no. These are arbitrary values derived from market value of the entity, basically working almost like a ""commission"".

Pro Sports Athletes and Actors are paid partially based on their abilities. There are only a certain select few that can hit a round ball with a round bat travelling at them in excess of 90 mph.

If a coupe has a B pillar there shouldn't be any difference in torsional stiffness; in my experience with BMWs I've found that any weight difference is a function of how the car is optioned.

The reason I don't like sunroofs is because they add @65 pounds to the highest point on the car- and in the case of the M3 or M4 it's even worse- because a hole in the roof replaces the CF roof with steel...

4-doors add weight as compared to 2-doors because doors are heavy and 4 > 2. Granted, the coupe usually has bigger doors, but not twice as big or heavy.

That's a good point.

Assuming a curb weight of 3500 pounds, 65 lbs. is less than 2% of the total weight.

How much does that really raise the center of gravity - less than an inch? I'd guess that 99% or more of the driving population wouldn't know - or care - about that.

And for the remaining 1%, your last name would have to be Senna or Earnhardt to really have it matter.
2% more weight can mean 2% more wear on everything, from brake pads to the suspension to the tires. Can also reduce fuel economy.

When I was a kid working in a gas station we used to charge up condensers. Just jam the clip into the end of a spark plug wire, start the car and hold the can about a quarter inch from the engine block for about thirty seconds.

I charged one up and laid it on the workbench. I learned several new words in Italian when my bosses father in law happened to pick it up! He swore loudly and bounced up and down for a good ten seconds. Good thing my boss never told him how it happened to get charged up. Another time, I got myself when I fiddled with one while on the telephone. So many things we cant do with modern cars!"

That sounds like many farmers I know, getting over leveraged and then having one or two bad crop years. I disagree with the author’s clickbait premise that greed caused the collapse. A few dozens of millions spread around the upper management was a drop in the bucket compared to $20 billion in debt. What was the alternative, let all your executives jump ship and leave the company in turmoil. Like it or not $10-20 million in compensation for a CEO is routine these days. If they had turned things around they would have been heroes.

My own business model was to not take on any kind of debt. While ultimately safe it restricted my ability to ramp up production or take advantage of new opportunities. I couldn’t afford to risk losing my home but I also never made a whole lot of money.

Capitalism rewards risk but the downside is pretty brutal.
One of the most contentious cases I ever dealt with involved a farm family who kept borrowing money from their PCA(remember those?). When the family’s farming business finally collapsed the banks foreclosed. I represented a retired couple who had sold the family a small adjacent farm with a lien retained. The family was stiffing my clients claiming that the reason they couldn’t pay that lien was because the banks wouldn’t loan them any more money.
And their defense to the banks’ foreclosure?
“You shouldn’t have loaned us so much money- you should have known we couldn’t pay it back!”

My clients finally prevailed but it was a royal mess, thanks to at least one totally incompetent attorney and an inept bleeding heart judge.

Executive compensation is a convenient straw man for those seeking to generate outrage over the unfairness of the capitalist system. A few years back there was a concerted effort to shame Walmart over the CEOs $20 million salary compared to the regular employee’s. The implication was that the $20 million should be distributed to the “team” if you will. What the advocates didn’t mention was this would result in an additional payment to the workers of only $2.

Personally I don’t think you can hire a better CEO for $20 million than you could for $1 million but in the end that’s a matter for the shareholders. I think the idea of “fairness” in business is a red herring that leads to equality of poverty.

Yeah, I agree with that. Corporate raiders like Icahn didn’t help Hertz in the end. But if you viewed that video he wasn’t the first to buy and sell the company. Some sellers made out good while others overpaid and lost their shirts.

The selling price of a car is fixed in that it costs a certain amount to produce it....so I can't expect them to sell it to me for a fraction of the cost it took to make it.

If you have a short attention span, don't watch it.
A few more random thoughts. Would Hertz have survived if the world didn't stop suddenly because of the pandemic? They probably would have, but no one could foresee the travel business would suddenly come to a screeching standstill. A lot of businesses may not survive....cruise ship industry, large hotels, resorts, restaurants, airlines. Companies usually expand based on assets...Hertz was overextended, but they thought they were on a roll. Business sometimes operates in a risky way.....it has to stay positive and plan to grow or you get trampled on, but, also be defensive just in case a crash occurs.......you have to be good to survive and a bit lucky.

Personally I don’t think you can hire a better CEO for $20 million than you could for $1 million but in the end that’s a matter for the shareholders. I think the idea of “fairness” in business is a red herring that leads to equality of poverty.

Off my soapbox now.
The CEO of Walmart pay distributed among all wal mart's employees would result in each employee getting just under $11 extra a year or a half a cent an hour presuming everyone works a 40 hour week. Most CEOs salaries work out to a small amount of money per employee.

Generally it’s okay to use a term like that if you’re from that group, because then you own it and it’s not a slur. That’s how Foxworthy uses it. If you’re not, best to avoid. Then you’re tarring someone with a well known put down. As a Jew, we have lots of in jokes amongst ourselves that would be highly Offensive if outsiders said them.

Long, long ago I was interested in how much the CEO pay for people ""leading"" large companies was. Mostly my interest was I held stock in and purchased the products of those companies. The major problem I learned over the years was there's an inside buddy system of people being put on boards of multiple companies. Cross pollution.
I saw some of this in my last job. Board members charged with recruiting new Board members looked first to those that they knew from other Boards. Second on the list were people who would check off a diversity box. Sadly, last were those with neither of those qualities but who had exactly the type of skills the Board needed. It wasn't good.

In terms of executive pay, there is a bootstrap effect in play. Compensation committees often hire consultants to provide survey info on comparative salary levels of other CEOs from supposedly comparable companies. In my experience those are easily rigged to give you the result you want, so you can always justify a bigger salary if you want to provide it. Unless the CEO has made enemies on the Board or is grossly inept (which the Board usually doesn't want to admit because they hired the person) they usually want to keep the CEO happy.

Had to drive the 15 pack after lunch again yesterday and really do hate it! But with our social distancing policy, there can only be one body/row going forward. The Dodge minivans can only be used with 3 total drivers. And for some reason, a lot of the lead drivers no longer drive the chase vehicles and just let the other drivers figure it out. I didn't want to really do it yesterday but the first guy asked said he wasn't quite up to it and would I do it instead? He's a few years older than I and we've become fast friends so of course I said sure but did throw in, ""I'd rather not"". But once he said he wasn't up to it today, I just said ""no problem"" and took over the driving.
Still very happy that shorts are now allowed on daily basis. Assuming and hoping that this new policy will stay in effect throughout the year. We do have a very short, moderate winter down here but some days, with the winds, it can get a bit chilly. On those days, long pants are the way to go. I just want to be the one who decides what I wear in that respect. They've already chosen our shirts for us so I like getting to chose everything else. Hoping they also change the color and material of or new shirts to. We look like Kermit the Frog with the current green they chose and the polo shirts don't breathe so well and get hot. They aren't perforated like the older polo's were and hoping they go back to that other breathable material next time. We've had over twenty days of 90+ weather and it's damn hot to be honest. Luckily the 15 packs have decent a/c units in them, two actually, since these are big vehicles.
Very fancy down there. We never got any shirts and you don’t even get a hat until 5 years of service. Some of the guys look like they dress from the Goodwill bin.

In fact we didn’t even get ID badges. Sometimes we’d go to an Enterprise location in another state and had trouble gaining entry because they wouldn’t take our word that we worked for the company.

65 pounds really isn't a lot if you're discussing cars that can weigh over 2 tons.
That's a good point.

Assuming a curb weight of 3500 pounds, 65 lbs. is less than 2% of the total weight.

How much does that really raise the center of gravity - less than an inch? I'd guess that 99% or more of the driving population wouldn't know - or care - about that.

And for the remaining 1%, your last name would have to be Senna or Earnhardt to really have it matter.

I remember changing a tire on our old Datsun 510 with the flimsy scissors jack it came with. No bumper jack for that! I remember rotating tires using all five tires, jacking up each corner of the car one at a time, tire off, tire on, next corner, tire off, tire on, etc. What a pain. Then having to put the newly designated spare back in the trunk, properly secured. No loose tire or tools allowed. I’m tired just thinking about it.

Interesting story about Hertz bankruptcy.

That sounds like many farmers I know, getting over leveraged and then having one or two bad crop years. I disagree with the author’s clickbait premise that greed caused the collapse. A few dozens of millions spread around the upper management was a drop in the bucket compared to $20 billion in debt. What was the alternative, let all your executives jump ship and leave the company in turmoil. Like it or not $10-20 million in compensation for a CEO is routine these days. If they had turned things around they would have been heroes.

My own business model was to not take on any kind of debt. While ultimately safe it restricted my ability to ramp up production or take advantage of new opportunities. I couldn’t afford to risk losing my home but I also never made a whole lot of money.

4511,Jul-12,sb55,"I did a marathon drive last week. I have an Airstream trailer that we decided to store in Natural Bridge, VA for the winter, so we could get to it without too much risk of bad weather for a planned trip in March. Anyway, then COVID-19 happened so the trip was cancelled. Last week, Vermont relaxed it's quarantine rules, so I decided to go get it. I left at 4:30 am. Coffee, Mountain Dew and snacks were in play, and I made the 720 miles in 11 hours. Got the Airstream out of storage and was at a campsite to de-winterize (in 98 deg. heat) by 4:30. All went well. The original plan was to hang out for a day and recover from the trip. But I felt OK so decided to leave the next morning. I figured that it would take 2 days towing a 30' trailer and not being able to go quite as fast. I guess that I got in a zone, because I felt fine. I made the trip home in 11.5 hours. I only stopped for gas twice and peed in my towed house, so minimal contact. I didn't know at my advanced age if I could do a trip like that, but was glad that it worked out.
Some observations. The Silverado with the 6.2 motor and max tow package is great for me. It got 23.3 mpg on the way to VA and 13.3 towing a 7000+lb trailer on the way back. That's with the A/C on the whole trip. As for COVID-19. Bathrooms on the NYS thruway had every other stall, urinal and sinks roped off. Electric hand dryers sealed. Almost everyone was masked. Had to pee again in a PA rest area. No social distancing inside and hand dryers were operational, but most were masked. One more pee in VA. No social distancing, hand dryers operational and most not masked. Glad to be back in Vermont!

Why are you so crabby about this? The only person brazenly announcing anything is you. Some people are DIYers, some aren’t. I don’t know why you think that’s some kind of test. I’m happy you enjoy it, but I’m not bowing in awe either. Can’t we just all get along without casting aspersions (or as my significant other would say, “casting a Persian”)?
I’m sincerely sorry I put a twist in your delicate undies, but not to worry- I’ve reconciled myself to the fact that there are some individuals who define themselves by their ability to use a phone. And I promise to make every effort to keep in mind that not everyone who posts in this topic can tackle such fiendishly complex tasks as reading their owners manual, checking the oil or checking and adjusting tire pressures(even though we somehow manage to teach those procedures to 16 year old students at Street Survival).

Having said all that, if I DID do something that made you “bow in awe” I would have to admit that I would immediately question whatever I had done.

I did watch the video. The guy doing it might not be an idiot but I'd guess he often gets mistaken for one. In one breath he criticizes them for leasing their fleet, then he goes on to talk about how they leveraged the fleet assets to borrow money. You can't do that if you don't own the fleet, so what is it? As for the rest, he skims over the 9 straight profitable quarters and then after setting up the premise it wasn't the shutdown of travel that killed them, says just that. I'm sure the private equity bunch and Icahn did suck money out of the company, but they had over 2 years of consistent profits until the travel ban hit. But the narrator obviously didn't want a good clickbait headline to go to waste.

A few million or two would be appropriate, but the amount corporations dole out to top executives is usually 60-100 million dollars in bonuses which is ludicrous and outrageous while working peons slave on the line to make those billions in profits.

Everyone in a successful company should benefit from huge profits because achieving record profits is more than realized by great leaders - it takes a great ""team"" to be truly successful.

We're dealing with human behavior in an attempt to convince people to wear masks, self-distance, avoid large groupings, avoid eating inside a restaurant, etc. When you deal with human behavior, it's impossible to get everyone to agree to specific behaviors.

That's why I said that until we have a vaccine that is effective against covid-19 and potential mutated versions, we will be living like this!

I wear a mask all the time! I avoid groups of people! I don't eat out! When I walk in the mall for exercise, security requires masks and distancing. The mall right now is almost empty which is why I have continued my daily walking. If I felt there was a danger in coming to the mall, I would stop coming.

When I shop for food, I go to a Publix 3 miles from me instead of the one across the street because it is so crowded there.

I only pray we have an effective vaccine in 4-6 months.

As to doors, 4 doors have a lot of advantages. If you ever have rear passengers, defintiely a plus. But even with just me, oversized doors often became inconvenient. In tight parking lots especially. Not too bad on a small car (your Ti door is probably the same size as a 3 series 4 door). But bigger cars like a Camaro, heavy, tended to sag, and wham into cars next to you (the reason I will never, ever, park next to a 2 door car).

the only legit reason I ever saw was if you had a wheelchair, so you could get it into the back seat. Other than that it was just for image reasons (no different than refusing to drive a minivan when you actually had use for one!)

I bet a 4 door is lighter and stiffer than a 2 door also. If not having a moonroof for that reason is important, should be a reason to get a 4 door!

We do have a very short, moderate winter down here but some days, with the winds, it can get a bit chilly. On those days, long pants are the way to go. I just want to be the one who decides what I wear in that respect. They've already chosen our shirts for us so I like getting to chose everything else. Hoping they also change the color and material of or new shirts to. We look like Kermit the Frog with the current green they chose and the polo shirts don't breathe so well and get hot. They aren't perforated like the older polo's were and hoping they go back to that other breathable material next time. We've had over twenty days of 90+ weather and it's damn hot to be honest. Luckily the 15 packs have decent a/c units in them, two actually, since these are big vehicles.

I got that number from none other than TC Kline himself.

The panorama roof in my E450 actually provides more headroom for me than the E450 with the standard sun roof. I sat in both and hit my head on the roof in the standard roof version which I solved by lowering the seat. Too bad we couldn't find an E450 with standard roof and well optioned.

He keeps on trying to convince her to sell it and get something she likes but she won't do it. Stay tuned. If I got it it'd be replacing the Miata. Since one of the issues from the transplant is developing skin cancers (3 so far) some of the convertible magic wears off. Stay tuned.

Still have my RADIO SHACK SPL meter. I use it to double check the AVR's settings.

I remember a guy who paid a lot for an AVR to hook up to his Bose HT system (the ones with the cubes and little bass module). Told him it was kinda like putting a square peg in a round hole. But, he insisted. Trying to remember, I think it was a higher end Onkyo AVR (when Onkyo made decent equipment, which they don't any more).

Hooked it up just like a 5.1 set of speakers, although the little cubes were supposed to be connected through the Bose bass module. Instead, I hooked them into the Onkyo and the Bose bass module into the ""pre-out"".

Sounded horrible. Obviously, hooking the Bose Cubes to the AVR vs hooking it to the Bose bass module bypassed whatever signal manipulation Bose employs. Plus, the Bose bass module, getting a full 20Hz-80Hz signal from the AVR distorted terribly. Again, Bose was only trying to reproduce the mid-bass frequencies. The cubes weren't much better when it came to distortion. Obviously, without the digital signal processing Bose employs, their speakers are terrible.

I recall when your Yamaha, the Pioneer Elite SC 09, the Denon 5805, etc were at the top of the AVR heap....powerful amps, technologically advanced, and as good as any high end equipment on the market. Now, with the mergers (Denon and Marantz merged, Pioneer and Onkyo merged), the equipment becomes a product of the economies of scale.

I was at the tail end of TVs with tubes. I do recall my parents getting a Motorola TV because (allegedly) you could fix it without a technician. The theory, it had a drawer you could pull out and change circuit boards that went bad. Again, in theory. The issue, not knowing which circuit board was bad unless you had a very expensive tester (like testing tubes). Those circuit boards were not cheap, either. I recall my Father laying down some very tangy words going from one circuit board to the next, trying to fix ours. He'd pull a board out, put a new one in, only to realize that didn't fix the TV. Mail the board back to Motorola and wait for the new one to show up, wash, rinse, repeat.

He went from that TV to one called Curtis Mathes (which to this day, I don't think I've ever seen another one outside of the one we had). Allegedly, the best TV money could buy. I don't remember the picture being all that special, but it was a self contained TV and stereo in a big wooden cabinet. The TV wasn't memorable, but the stereo was my intro in listening to my first STEREO albums, and it got loud.

I saved the pittance I made doing jobs around the neighborhood (mowing, gutter cleaning, raking, etc) and bough my own personal TV for my bedroom...a 13"" Sony Trinitron. He thought Sony TVs were crap (based on where they were made), even though they were some of the best TVs on the market at the time (also most expensive). Kept that TV through middle school, high school and it followed me to college. Still played well, with the best looking picture of any TV I had seen up until that point. I gave it to my baby sister for her to put in her bedroom, and it probably played another 4-5 years. I think it finally gave up the ghost after 15 year of heavy use, and probably could have been fixed if my sister cared just a tad bit.

And yes, I found out about the electricity stored in capacitors the same way as you. Not a pleasant experience.

Yeah...as @roadburner mentioned, a lot of that is redundant. That Marantz has copper shielding throughout. 8K content simply doesn’t exist in any mainstream form. Like 3D, I kind of question the demand for the format.

I know of NO ONE who’s ever used an RS232 port on an AVR. The speaker connections assume 7 main/surround channels and 4 “height” channels for Dolby Atmos and DTS X. My speakers offer very wide dispersion so I don’t feel the need for height channels. I do have 2 subwoofers (RB, your HSU is nice). One for the mid bass and one for lower Hz. Both are made by one of the original members of a well respected internet audio company (SVS). Mine are PSA.

Why anyone is using an AVR for AM or FM radio is also a curiously. Both formats are limited in both frequency and are very compressed (except for the HD channels). Most radio stations can be heard via HD, which is a digital format that you can get via the internet. This particularly AVR that I just installed has WiFi capability. So, I can stream stations from that. No need for an antenna.

The analog connections (white/red) are for outputting to a separate amp. I did that for a while on one of my older installations. But, the amps in the top end AVRs these days are really good. Mine has a large power supply and individual amp modules that are isolated from each other (another reason why it’s so big and heavy). So, I don’t use a separate amp anymore. The Denon I just installed has no problem effortlessly driving my entire system to reference levels and beyond.

IF you have ANY component so old that you have to connect it via RGB, co-axial, component or Any analog cables, this probably isn’t the AVR for you. It would be WAY overkill for an installation that would utilize those connections. That said, I do know people who are still married to their VHS/Beta tapes (which look terrible even when compared to DVD disks).

HDMI is THE way you want to connect whatever you can. Most current AVRs have more than enough HDMI connections. HDMI (current) cables can carry Ultra HD (4K) video and multiple channels of lossless audio. So, the optical cable connection is redundant, too...and that’s just for audio.

At the end of the day, I know how to hook up the most complex Home Theater systems. I’ve done it many, many times for myself and many, many times for others. If you are easily confused, don’t care how to utilize one of these AVRs, don’t care how to maximize performance, yeah...I guess hire someone to do the installation for you. Be prepared to pay dearly for the privilege. Me? I do it for a 6 pack of local brew.

The issue isn’t just making the connections, it’s wrestling with a 50+ pound AVR (which is what mine weighs). I don’t just twist speaker wires in a terminal, it’s terminating them with high quality spade or banana plugs. Believe it or not, it used to be worse. It used to be every component to be connected to an AVR had 4 separate connections you needed to make...3 RGB and one optical, co-axial or component cables. Now, it’s just one HDMI.

This is my first Denon AVR. It’s built extremely well. It is powerful. It has great decoders and DACs. It’s firmware can be updated via WiFi. My hope is that I get as many years from it as I got from my Pioneer Elite (10+). My only beef, at this price point, you’d think they could include a universal remote that lights up. That was not to be, though. I do use my Firestick remote for ON/OFF and Volume control. But, when I have to switch component ports on the AVR, I have to use the Denon remote. Minor inconvenience. But, still.......

I’m sure that’s more than ANYONE wanted to know. But, that is how I get the picture and sound that I get (big hat tip to LG OLED TV technology, too). Watching Saving Private Ryan again with this current setup (LG OLED and Denon AVR) was simply stunning.
Not all of Onkyo is complete junk yet. The RZ line is still good quality and carries a longer 3 year warranty. Why anyone would want to buy the cheap stuff with a paltry ""1 year or 2 year"" warranty is beyond me. Stick to the RZ line. Nothing spells ""poor quality"" like reduced warranty times on electronics; particularly the ""90 day"" products out there.

I think I have the 820 which is 2 years older than the 840 linked above. It's a bit better in that it dedicates all of its power to 7.2 rather than splitting it 9.2 ways (same weight). As I said, a 3 year warranty pretty much ensures a bit more quality, but rumor is a lot of these modern receivers have a lot of issues from all brands...keeping the few repair places still open busy.

Yep! In reality very few of those RCA jacks will ever be used. I’m impressed by the turntable input. Many receivers have omitted that for the last two decades.
Turntables have made a comeback! They are ""in"" right now. However, don't be too impressed. I think my Denon didn't have a turntable input, but my Onkyo does. Since I owned the Denon first, I had bought a Pro-Ject pre-amp for about $70 from Crutchfield to bridge the gap. The Onkyo comes with a ""Phono"" input, but they'd have been better off omitting it like Denon. It works, but it works so poorly it is a joke. The $70-$80 pre-amp works 10X better! Junk! Better not to include something rather than throw junk in a receiver.

I have rear drums on my 2008 Mercury Mariner. Fronts are disc. Thought about a disc pad conversion kit for better stopping power, but I guess it wouldn't make that much of a difference since the front brakes do the majority of the braking?
I think rear discs became a status symbol around 2010 when even run of the mill cars got them. My 95’ Lincoln and my top trim 2000 convertible had them, the kid’s 2005 Sable didn’t nor did the 2009 Chrysler.

My thoughts on this continuing saga of the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the resulting deaths it causes is simple - ""...you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't...!""

There is no simple answer to this horror we are all facing. To stop the virus dead in its tracks, everyone must stay at home and businesses must close down. Isn't that simple? Of course it is, BUT how do you eat and how do you have your AC repaired and how do you have your plumbing fixed and hundreds of other problems result from that one simple decision.

There are going to be more deaths and hospitalizations until the public is vaccinated against this awful virus and humans develop an immunity. And then we wait for the next virus to spread! It's a dilemma because no matter what we or the government does, until an effective vaccine is developed and given to everyone, we are in this mess for the duration.

Sure you can reduce deaths and hospitalizations by wearing masks and going out only when needed, but you cannot eliminate it 100%, or even 75%, or even 60%. 50% maybe, but there is a limit to how effective putting these restrictions on the populous will be in stopping the spread of this virus.

What Is The Dunning-Kruger Effect?
Put simply, the Dunning-Kruger Effect is the tendency for people to misjudge their abilities. People with less than average abilities tend to overestimate their true abilities, while those with higher than average abilities tend to not realize how much better they are. That is, some people are too stupid to know how stupid they are, while smart people assume most can do what they can. In their original 1999 paper entitled “Unskilled and unaware of it: How difficulties in recognizing one’s own incompetence lead to inflated self-assessments,” Dunning and Kruger claimed that the “miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others.”

I guess the point is....it is sometimes hard to know who is an expert, and it is hard for experts to understand that others can't do what they do. But, everyone is probably good at some skill, but very few - probably no one is good at everything!

Yep! In reality very few of those RCA jacks will ever be used. I’m impressed by the turntable input. Many receivers have omitted that for the last two decades.

If you look closer it’s actually pretty simple; the lower jacks are for speakers while the RCA jacks are redundant inputs for the HDMI inputs. Lots of inputs=lots of jacks/sockets.
This perceived complexity is why so many HTS installers get away with charging very high prices to set up mediocre systems.

You just gave away the secret of how to go about hooking up a complex system. You can’t look at the whole thing. You have to work it in pieces.

That kinda reminded me of looking over a schematic diagram one day when a young lady, that worked in our commercial department, marched into my cube and said, “hey @jmonroe, you got it figured out yet, my customer is getting antsy”. I said, “I’m getting there, the problem is in this section here”. She said, “with all those lines, I’ll never know how you guys can figure that stuff it out”. I tried to explain to her you have to attack it in pieces. She walked away saying thanks for trying to explain it but it’s still Greek to me”. Some people get hung up with the BIG picture.

Putting a car on jack stands properly simply isn’t that hard. 99% of the cases involving cars falling on someone involve a person who is either lazy, stupid, or both- so these incidents usually end up being nothing more than the Law of Natural Selection operating as expected.

There must be a fair number of ""lazy, stupid people"". If you consider these statistics;

Along with those 150,000 people who injured themselves closing a car door, another 10,000 each year are seriously injured when using a jack or other type of hoist.

Millions of people open and close car doors ever day, and 150000 people a year injure themselves doing it. What percentage of people jack up their car, yet 10000 a year injure themselves doing that? I would say, that's a huge number of injuries, for the number of people who actually do this kind of thing.

4640,Jul-08,stickguy,"generally, you are doing a risk/reward analysis, along with cost/benefit.

so putting up new blinds to save say $50/each? Easy call, because there is no risk to me, and if it gets screwed up, worst that happens is it is crooked or falls down. Neither result is fatal or painful. Falling off the roof of a 2 story house, well, different story! Same reason I paint. It is pretty easy, no real risk, and expensive to have done.

using the brakes example, different inputs. Usually you need more than just pads (and even then, there are some extras). so once you are getting into jacking the car up and mucking around in the wheel well, some risk there. Then there is the places (especially on a modern car) where you can manage to break something else like an ABS connector. So yeah, it is not horribly complicated, but there are plenty of chances of a ""gotcha"" moment, especially if you are not really experienced with it (and of course have all the right gear). And since it it quick for a pro, the cost of the labor is really not all that high (I can get brakes installed for less than they want to charge to put up a ceiling fan).

cutting into plumbing or gas lines, same thing. The opportunities to have something go horribly wrong are much higher!

Of course....always the wide end with the jaws.
When I was dating my future wife, and visiting her and her parents at their lake house, my 63 Dodge Dart was making a grinding noise. Figuring it had something to do with the brakes, I took the tire off and about 10 brake parts fell out on the ground. Not having any idea how to put them back together, I took the other front tire off to see how the assembled brakes looked. Then it was pretty easy to put the parts back together and be on my way. Future father in law was impressed (he graduated 2nd in his chemical engineering class at Tulsa University) with my impromptu repair and said he would never have thought to do that.

A few years later I found him sweating in a stifling hot garage, trying to snap the cover that fits under the door of his freezer back on. He couldn't find the little holes that the grill snapped into because they were blocked from sight by the overhang of the bottom of the freezer door. I took the grill from him, opened the freezer door, which exposed the holes, and snapped it back into place. He just stared at me for a minute, shook his head, and walked away.

I wonder how many people actually use this many output channels in any house and they how many of those have actually come across a media that's capable of using that setup to its fullest those at least ones. Seems like just adding relatively cheap stuff to keep prices up, otherwise the competition would kill the manufacturers same way TV did. I think a nice 5.1 is all person needs. 6.1 or 7.1/7.2 can have its use for a dedicated multimedia room in a huge house. I have 6.2 Pioneer Elite, several years old, use only one subwoofer and have to keep it down because of neighbors. I like the cinematic sound and the stereo is really nice.

My ‘75 Grand Prix was the first car I owned that had a catalytic converter. That caused unwanted constipation for the 400 CID V8 to the point I had to do something. So, I removed the plug on the bottom of it and drained a full gallon of the constipating pellets from it. It ran so much better after that minor surgery. Took less time than doing an oil change.

Fast forward to when I bought my ‘80 Park Ave. That car had the 350 CID V8 and because it was a smaller engine with the same size catalytic converter the performance was even more noticeable. When I climbed under the car to remove the plug, I got a surprise. GM no longer provided a drain plug. They now had a pressed in plug. Rather than chisel it out and having to go to a dealer for a new pressed in plug, if they even made such a thing, I looked in the J.C. Whitney catalog and found a “catalytic converter eliminator pipe”. It fit perfectly and I no longer had a constipation problem with that car either. In fact, because the entire catalytic converter was removed, the performance increase was even more noticeable than just removing the constipating pellets like I did on my Grand Prix.

A little more fast forward (maybe 2 years). A friend at work came to me with a new copy of the J.C. Whitney catalog. They no longer called it a “catalytic converter eliminator pipe”. Now, because it circumvented a pollution system device, it was renamed a “catalytic converter test pipe”. The instructions said that if you suspected that your catalytic converter was clogged, you should remove it, install the “test pipe” and if your car ran better, you found the problem. So you were then instructed to remove the “test pipe” and get a new catalytic converter because it was illegal to leave the “test pipe” permanently installed. Yeah right, I’m sure everyone followed the newish government law and did that.

jmonroe

So that's where the term ""test pipes"" comes from!!! You learn something new every day here. My A3 ran and sounded great with ""test pipes"" as my downpipe, cat removal, and a Borla muffler/tailpipe.

Really magnified the glorious DSG sounds and lighting fast shifts.

CA takes draconian law to some higher order of obnoxiousness. It isn't good enough to pass the smog test (sniffing test at the tailpipes). You have to pass visual inspection for ""CA/CARB APPROVED"" stamped on all your emissions system parts. So what is more important, the air quality, or that someone got paid an excessive fee bribe to stamp a part with ""CA/CARB approved?""

lol! So true. You’d think dot matrix displays would be long gone by now. But, the UI on these current receivers for set up are worlds better than what was on my old receiver.
I hope your Denon lasts you longer than the 3.75 years my Denon 4520 also ""made in Japan"" gave me. Like I said, if they supported it with replacement parts, I'd of spent a reasonable amount to repair it, but no way am I committing to $200 + shipping without a guarantee they have parts for it.

I was actually slightly disappointed with its performance, but it was a very good receiver when it worked. I've come to the conclusion there's just no way a 30 pound receiver can compete with a 50 pound HK (at the amp level at least).

It only had 1 other flaw other than its lack of durability and longevity. They made it impossible to apply the fantastic pre-amp processing power to the 7.1 analog inputs. Only direct transfer, clean, pure, but off.

Saw someone get kicked out of my local Costco yesterday for taking her mask off in the store. Why this is, when Costco has made it abundantly clear that it's a requirement to wear a mask inside their stores, is totally confusing to me. As she was being escorted out, I heard her say she would never shop at Costco again. At which, about a dozen people applauded her decision.

The other question, why Costco? They are very serious about keeping their stores as antiseptically clean as they possibly can. How is that a bad thing and why does that bother so many people?

I saw an article on CNET about a newly-introduced Marantz A/V receiver that can handle 8K video. Seeing the pic of the back panel of the thing in the article made me glad I an no longer an audio/videophile. I had a headache just looking at it, and now better understand @graphicguy 's frustration at hooking up his new device.

Yeah...as @roadburner mentioned, a lot of that is redundant. That Marantz has copper shielding throughout. 8K content simply doesn’t exist in any mainstream form. Like 3D, I kind of question the demand for the format.

I know of NO ONE who’s ever used an RS232 port on an AVR. The speaker connections assume 7 main/surround channels and 4 “height” channels for Dolby Atmos and DTS X. My speakers offer very wide dispersion so I don’t feel the need for height channels. I do have 2 subwoofers (RB, your HSU is nice). One for the mid bass and one for lower Hz. Both are made by one of the original members of a well respected internet audio company (SVS). Mine are PSA.

Why anyone is using an AVR for AM or FM radio is also a curiously. Both formats are limited in both frequency and are very compressed (except for the HD channels). Most radio stations can be heard via HD, which is a digital format that you can get via the internet. This particularly AVR that I just installed has WiFi capability. So, I can stream stations from that. No need for an antenna.

The analog connections (white/red) are for outputting to a separate amp. I did that for a while on one of my older installations. But, the amps in the top end AVRs these days are really good. Mine has a large power supply and individual amp modules that are isolated from each other (another reason why it’s so big and heavy). So, I don’t use a separate amp anymore. The Denon I just installed has no problem effortlessly driving my entire system to reference levels and beyond.

IF you have ANY component so old that you have to connect it via RGB, co-axial, component or Any analog cables, this probably isn’t the AVR for you. It would be WAY overkill for an installation that would utilize those connections. That said, I do know people who are still married to their VHS/Beta tapes (which look terrible even when compared to DVD disks).

HDMI is THE way you want to connect whatever you can. Most current AVRs have more than enough HDMI connections. HDMI (current) cables can carry Ultra HD (4K) video and multiple channels of lossless audio. So, the optical cable connection is redundant, too...and that’s just for audio.

At the end of the day, I know how to hook up the most complex Home Theater systems. I’ve done it many, many times for myself and many, many times for others. If you are easily confused, don’t care how to utilize one of these AVRs, don’t care how to maximize performance, yeah...I guess hire someone to do the installation for you. Be prepared to pay dearly for the privilege. Me? I do it for a 6 pack of local brew.

The issue isn’t just making the connections, it’s wrestling with a 50+ pound AVR (which is what mine weighs). I don’t just twist speaker wires in a terminal, it’s terminating them with high quality spade or banana plugs. Believe it or not, it used to be worse. It used to be every component to be connected to an AVR had 4 separate connections you needed to make...3 RGB and one optical, co-axial or component cables. Now, it’s just one HDMI.

This is my first Denon AVR. It’s built extremely well. It is powerful. It has great decoders and DACs. It’s firmware can be updated via WiFi. My hope is that I get as many years from it as I got from my Pioneer Elite (10+). My only beef, at this price point, you’d think they could include a universal remote that lights up. That was not to be, though. I do use my Firestick remote for ON/OFF and Volume control. But, when I have to switch component ports on the AVR, I have to use the Denon remote. Minor inconvenience. But, still.......

I’m sure that’s more than ANYONE wanted to know. But, that is how I get the picture and sound that I get (big hat tip to LG OLED TV technology, too). Watching Saving Private Ryan again with this current setup (LG OLED and Denon AVR) was simply stunning.

If you have 4 patches it's time to get a newer tube, you wouldn't drive a car that has a tire with 4 plugs in it would you? Make sure your tube is the proper size for the tire, if it's too wide you could pinch it installing it. Also are you using the right tools taking off and putting on the tire? You should be using a tire level.

This is what I was thinking also. Down in the desert it's very (very) common to get flats from the various thorns that pollute the ground, and some of them are tiny. It's helpful to lay the tube on top of the tire and note where the patches are, bearing in mind that either the tire or tube could have been mounted ""upside down"" resulting in mirror image patches, relative to the valve stem. Either way, note where the patches are and get in the best possible light, and see what you can feel when the casing is turned inside out. I've been down this road more than a few times Odds are, if you don't find the root cause, even a new tube will go flat shortly after it's mounted. Good luck.

Well....looks like SW OH is back on the mandatory mask wearing in public again. For reasons that just confound me, some (not many) of our local citizenry just doesn't get how important it is to wear a mask.

Saw someone get kicked out of my local Costco yesterday for taking her mask off in the store. Why this is, when Costco has made it abundantly clear that it's a requirement to wear a mask inside their stores, is totally confusing to me. As she was being escorted out, I heard her say she would never shop at Costco again. At which, about a dozen people applauded her decision.

The other question, why Costco? They are very serious about keeping their stores as antiseptically clean as they possibly can. How is that a bad thing and why does that bother so many people?

Just using this as a learning moment, not accusing anyone or anything;
What Is The Dunning-Kruger Effect?
Put simply, the Dunning-Kruger Effect is the tendency for people to misjudge their abilities. People with less than average abilities tend to overestimate their true abilities, while those with higher than average abilities tend to not realize how much better they are. That is, some people are too stupid to know how stupid they are, while smart people assume most can do what they can. In their original 1999 paper entitled “Unskilled and unaware of it: How difficulties in recognizing one’s own incompetence lead to inflated self-assessments,” Dunning and Kruger claimed that the “miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others.”

I guess the point is....it is sometimes hard to know who is an expert, and it is hard for experts to understand that others can't do what they do. But, everyone is probably good at some skill, but very few - probably no one is good at everything!

I did have a pro who proved to be woefully incompetent and dishonest to boot.

This was several years ago. Had a drain stopped up in the kitchen sink. I used my tools (namely a drain snake) and cleaned out the “trap” to no avail.

Called a plumber as I wanted to use my sink.

I had an emergency call for work, and left the plumber’s supervision to my son, who was in college and still living at home at the time.

I came out of my upstairs office after dousing the work related “fire” and found the plumber, in my rec room (in the basement) tearing apart a wall and ceiling tiles. I was livid. He said the only way to get to the blockage was through the walls.

Understand, I had the drain cleared before. A plumber with a long enough snake and a little bit of power would have cleared it in 5 minutes. I asked this plumber if he had tried that. He said he didn’t because he knew it wouldn’t work.

I kicked him out of the house and had a “good” plumber to come back and clear the sink with a long snake.

The first plumber had the gall to take me to small claims court for not paying him for the work he did. I had pictures of the damage he did, as well as the receipt from the 2nd plumber showing how he cleared the leak with the snake.

I countersued for the repairs to the wall and ceiling.

Magistrate heard the case, asked the plumber why he didn’t use a snake to clear the sink. Plumber said he didn’t have his in his truck at the time.

Hit the plumber with the bill for the ceiling and wall repair, plus the court filing fees.

Tried to collect but the plumber disappeared without a trace. Phone number was out of service. The address on his invoice was to a building that had since been vacated.

I was SOOL.

About the only things I don't do any more is roofing (because I don't go up on a roof any more) and appliance repair (because my threshold is very, very low).

Major replacements such as furnaces and A/C systems I leave to the pros too.

I’m having a colonoscopy tomorrow, so I’ve been on clear liquids all day today. To keep myself occupied I decided to try my hand at replacing the seeping VANOS Oil Line. Shop booked it at 1.5-2 hours of labor plus the part ($31). I knocked it out in 45 minutes which included wrestling with the air box for a few minutes.

Turns out someone had been in there before with this part because the lower connection had the crush washers installed incorrectly and it was a huge oily mess. Anyway, I cleaned it up, properly installed it and buttoned it back up. Test drive after and no leak at either end. Successful mission.
Good job ( with the VANOS oil line, not the colonoscopy ). I spent 2 1/2 hours trying to change a tire on my son’s bicycle. And failed miserably. New tube. 2 holes. Patched both. The tube holds air, wrestle the tire back on. Test ride is ok. Sits in the garage for 5 minutes and it’s flat again. It’s maddening.

What dishonest salesperson conned an 80 year old to buy a speed3?
That was my thought.

At very least I know that if she does decide to sell that I know everything about the car because she's taken it to my mechanic for years.

And no need to worry about my having to talk anyone into it. Cliff, the mechanic, wants the Miata so there's a deal to be made if it comes to that.

My only concern is I have three more years of putting the youngest two kids through college.

As I posted over on the CCBA topic, The Kia Store East just received an Indigo Edition Stinger. The are only knocking off $3,500, which is only the Kia Motors rebate. Most other dealers are knocking off another $4,500-$5,000. graphicguy's dealer in Cincy is expecting one but has yet to receive it.
I may yet go look at it but I dread the games I'd have to play.
I also entered into an email correspondence with the Genesis dealer, which is currently located in one corner of Oxmoorons Hyundai. No RWD G70 Sport 3.3 cars in stock, but come in and test drive an AWD. Right. One of the things I really hate about Oxmoorons is that they add that stupid flasher to the CHMSL; just what I want- some minimum wage goofball splicing into the factory wiring harness.

At the time I was looking at midsize sedans, Kia had $4,000 rebates on the Kia Optima and another $1,000 in loyalty money. Just didn't care for the Optima. Was going to look at the Stinger if my Accord deal fell thru. My brother bought a new Kia Sedonna from Bob. if you go back, tell Bob that Jip (Jim) sent you.....I'll get a $200 referral fee if you buy that Stinger.

This is what I was thinking also. Down in the desert it's very (very) common to get flats from the various thorns that pollute the ground, and some of them are tiny. It's helpful to lay the tube on top of the tire and note where the patches are, bearing in mind that either the tire or tube could have been mounted ""upside down"" resulting in mirror image patches, relative to the valve stem. Either way, note where the patches are and get in the best possible light, and see what you can feel when the casing is turned inside out.

Yep, I remember setting the glue on fire too. I’d say I was about 11 or 12 when I started patching my tires rather than wait for my Dad to come home. My mother didn’t like the idea that I was using a pack of matches but my Dad convinced her I knew what I was doing since he watched me a few times, AND, I had to do my patching outside.

I assume they had biopsies and IIRC there are some other lab tests to assess the status of the cancer.
Many factors have to be included such as age and general health along with projected health and lifespan. Then there's the current stage of spread of the cancer.

Beyond that there are some radiation treatments that have various cute names but are targeted beams from multiple directions to kill most of the cancer cells hopefully. But sadly it seems to me that once the robot controlled resections became more common, a lot of doctors started those and the procedures aren't as careful and thorough as they could be. So the worse case is what you describe in incontinence and impotence, but worst of all the sloppy surgery (but profitable) leads to a recurrence of the cancer anyhow. So the patient gets the worst of both worlds.

Doctors also love the chemotherapy and general radiation treatments which are profitable for the hospitals as well.

One of the pin holes was caused by a tiny thorn that barely punctured the tire, but did make a hole in the tube. I also made the mistake of not taking the entire tire off. I’m going to buy some small hand pumps, extra tubes, & a patch kit for me, my son, & my wife.

@graphicguy good luck with that new receiver. I had never heard of 13.2 sound formats before, but I don't pay much attention to that sort of thing these days.

One thing I noticed in looking at all the different receivers they have on offer is that none of the manufacturers (at least the ones they carry) seem to have progressed very much in the display department - all of them have the same blue dot-matrix LED displays they had 20 years ago. I would have figured that by now they would have adopted the same sort of color graphic displays that automakers use in the the instument cluster.
lol! So true. You’d think dot matrix displays would be long gone by now. But, the UI on these current receivers for set up are worlds better than what was on my old receiver.

A man is stymied as he tries to find his girlfriend who wears that perfume. Everywhere he can smell the perfume, so he can’t possibly zero in on her.

My ‘75 Grand Prix was the first car I owned that had a catalytic converter. That caused unwanted constipation for the 400 CID V8 to the point I had to do something. So, I removed the plug on the bottom of it and drained a full gallon of the constipating pellets from it. It ran so much better after that minor surgery. Took less time than doing an oil change.

Fast forward to when I bought my ‘80 Park Ave. That car had the 350 CID V8 and because it was a smaller engine with the same size catalytic converter the performance was even more noticeable. When I climbed under the car to remove the plug, I got a surprise. GM no longer provided a drain plug. They now had a pressed in plug. Rather than chisel it out and having to go to a dealer for a new pressed in plug, if they even made such a thing, I looked in the J.C. Whitney catalog and found a “catalytic converter eliminator pipe”. It fit perfectly and I no longer had a constipation problem with that car either. In fact, because the entire catalytic converter was removed, the performance increase was even more noticeable than just removing the constipating pellets like I did on my Grand Prix.

A little more fast forward (maybe 2 years). A friend at work came to me with a new copy of the J.C. Whitney catalog. They no longer called it a “catalytic converter eliminator pipe”. Now, because it circumvented a pollution system device, it was renamed a “catalytic converter test pipe”. The instructions said that if you suspected that your catalytic converter was clogged, you should remove it, install the “test pipe” and if your car ran better, you found the problem. So you were then instructed to remove the “test pipe” and get a new catalytic converter because it was illegal to leave the “test pipe” permanently installed. Yeah right, I’m sure everyone followed the newish government law and did that.

I remember those cat test pipes. That’s a bit different than installing a hidden device to stop the odometer from recording. Also a test pipe can be seen with just a look under the car. These gizmos seem designed to be hidden.

4865,Jul-05,graphicguy,"Forgot who was asking, but after tinkering, testing, replacing parts, etc, I found a (relatively) local place who would service Pioneer Audio/Video Receiver. The bad news, the HDMI board is bad. They also mentioned the Capacitors were living on borrowed time, which was why the unit was going into overload. Plus, the digital amp modules were shutting down because of the heat generated. That’s most concerting given they’re digital modules and supposedly run cool.

Another $1,000 and I could get new capacitors installed. The digital amps are another issue. After procrastinating and bemoaning the fate of such a nice piece of equipment, I took the service center’s offer of $175 so they could use it for parts.

Bought the last one of these this store had in stock....

Done business before with these folks. Love doing business with them. Great products and service, plus they save me a couple of nickels whenever they can.

That’s the price one has to pay to get quality AV gear. Wrestled with it (not too far off the mark) to get it in my AV rack and reconnected to my home theater. It’s literally a beast.

While I was at it, I ended up putting new brass banana plugs on each end of my speaker wires. Replaced my old HDMI cables. And generally gave all the other equipment a once over.

Sounds a whole lot better than my old Pioneer Elite, which at the time was their top of the line. My hope is that this will last me a while. And, that I won’t have to replace anything else for quite some time (although my OPPO universal disk 4K UHD player is no longer made).

Girl friend heard me in the home theater room using unpolite language while setting everything up yesterday. She made me a Lynchburg Lemonade (not really my thing, but it was tasty and was quite a nice gesture by her). We watched Saving Private Ryan, which neither of us had seen in quite some time.

I checked around and all the places I contacted were $200-$300 for installation. Hopefully this will solve my problem.

Installation is more difficult since they have to cover the seats, etc., due to the fact that they are working ""up"" to apply the tint rather than on side windows. They use liquid to smooth the tint to adhere to the class and I don't want that stuff all over my leather seats.

I checked around and all the places I contacted were $200-$300 for installation. Hopefully this will solve my problem.

Installation is more difficult since they have to cover the seats, etc., due to the fact that they are working ""up"" to apply the tint rather than on side windows. They use liquid to smooth the tint to adhere to the class and I don't want that stuff all over my leather seats.

Anyone else tint the panorama roof? If so, what experience did you have? 🤓"

From an evolutionary perspective there is some group benefit from young people being risk takers. If young Johnny eats that unfamiliar fruit he might die or he might discover a new food source for the tribe. If no one takes the risk then no one may survive.
Oh I see. Hey Johnny, that looks interesting, why not try eating some of those raw cashew nuts over there?


(Cashews
Cashews are another delicious product that should never, ever be eaten raw. (When you buy them, they’ve usually been roasted.) Native to the Amazon, the cashew is not really a nut, but rather a seed that protrudes oddly from the bottom of a fruit (also edible, though rarely seen outside the tropics) called the cashew fruit. You may have noticed that cashews are never found in their shell as almonds or peanuts are, and that’s because when raw, they’re covered with anacardic acid, closely related to the acid that makes poison ivy so irritating. It’s much worse when you eat it.)

Driver, it's not the air temperature that makes it hot inside the car - it's the direct sunlight that causes the intense heat. Here in South Florida the direct rays of the sun are much more intense than in Toronto or New York.

I find it hard to believe that ABC wouldn’t fact check before reporting.

Speaking of fake news, I got a notice from my pharmacy and my insurance carrier about some sort of “contamination” in a medication that was a carcinogen. Being the skeptic I am I did some research and found that this scary substance was something found in water, hot dogs and vegetables. Furthermore one study I looked at said that if you consumed the amount involved every day for 70 years you had a 1 in 100,000 chance of developing cancer.

Stick, just spend one summer down here and it will make sense - believe me! With 88 degrees and 75% humidity, you keep the sunroof closed and the AC running on high fan speed. But it's usually 95 degrees out with 75%+ humidity.

Good advice. I've done that. When my daughter first reported it last Sunday, the first thing I did was tighten the cap. Monday she said it was on, I was hoping a few cycles it would turn off. Later that day I thought I'd take it to have it diagnosed and wait, the light was off. So I filled it up, made sure the cap was tight and all was well. Daughter drove the car several times Tuesday only to tell me the light is back on. I called the Honda dealership where I've had consistently good service and they suggested before I bring it in and them charge me $$ to diagnose the problem to first replace the gas cap with a new oem. I'll give that a try

Our library is doing that at some locations. But at our local smaller branch I think only one person comes in to handle the drop box and prep the reserves. The books are in new plastic bags with the reserve name tag on the book and they have wooden carts that are rolled into the building's lobby outside the library doors.

When folks call to ask for their reserve books, they are given a time for pickup. The folks are scheduled 5 minutes apart or so to avoid ""crowds"" of more than one coming into the lobby. Overkill but it works.

4933,Jul-02,imidazol97,"Yes indeed. The ABE books has been wonderful through the decades. I was able to find many books that way and easily get them shipped. My only surprise was one vendor was in Canada, so my credit card company added an exchange penalty to my credit card billing even though the company I thought I was paying was ABE in the US.

I even bought some of my son's specialty college books there by carefully comparing the ISBN's to the ones the profs at The OSU said were needed. I hope I didn't hurt the retirement funds of the profs who recommend purchasing the newest version of their money-making books they write or their buddy wrote (or more accurately, their graduate students wrote). LOL

I was even able to find some teacher editions when he was in high school and college. Finding errors in the answer sections the profs or their grad students put together was great.

Up here in NY a bunch of 20 year olds attended a “covid party” with one of the members who had it. They charged a fee to attend and the first who got sick won the money collected.

I can almost understand young people feeling invulnerable but that’s just bizarre.

Wear your mask when around other people. Period. My wife can't wear one for long times either. We're all the way up into the mid 80s here and it's uncomfortable.

The media has us focused on arguments about masks and the efficacy to distract. The media used to focus on death numbers but now has focused on the number of positive tests, which is increasing as people have asymptomatic or low symptom cases. The media hasn't focused on the death rate which is continuing to decrease. The data manipulation for purposes is astounding, as I said at the beginning of this spread.

I wear the doctor office type mask when I'm getting out of the car to go into any store. I keep wipes in the car for my hands and my door handles and steering wheel, etc..

masks outside, that is rough in the heat, but thankfully it (supposedly) is much less risky outdoors, at least if you aren't packed together like sardines (IOW at a typical beach bar).

I think the real focus again is on impact to hospitalization rate, which seems to be spiking in many areas. Even if deaths are down (a good thing) there is still the strain on the system. would be interesting to know if death rate is lower because of lessons learned (better treatments), or just because the newer cases are skewing to younger people (that can still have serious complications, even if less likely to die from them).

I generally agree, BUT you need to keep in mind you are risking coming into a close contact with others unexpectedly, by accident. So empty/ish parking lot, sure, playing percentages one can reasonably assume they can prevent it, but if you see people closer and closer... All it takes is an individual walking behind you, or you walking onto an individual, making those couple extra steps.

But one thing I still don't see people understanding and government officials are just pathetically failing to stress. YOUR the mask is NOT to protect you!!! Your mask is to protect ME, mine IS to protect you! Feeling OK is not a scientific test for not being infected, so unless you can somehow guarantee me you won't make that step towards me, and have such awesome powers that you can prevent others stepping in front of you, even accidentally, you can still be a source. We really should get over ourselves and all those ""but..."", ""but..."" and put the d.mn thing on, at least for next month or two. We won't break it with ""American spirit"" or screaming ""USA!, USA!"", we'll break it adhering to best advice science can give us, even if it evolves and doesn't get things right the first time.

It's true for virus you need a certain minimum amount for it to start replicating before being quashed by the immune system. But we don't know for sure how much, how long, the numbers will be different for different people, etc. All of this means caution is the way to go, for everybody, even those not particularly vulnerable, at least for next couple of months. The death rate is certainly lower and not as dramatic, as before, probably thanks to some advances in knowledge (like better awareness of vascular effects of Covid and treating those becoming key in survival) but let's wait two-three weeks to call a victory (it it is one), just so we don sound like my Governor with his victory proclamation two weeks before the explosion.

Of course the death rate will decrease with more testing (I wonder about some of it, perhaps some indicators have been in the system before this outbreak), but the death toll is still significant with many hospitals in crisis mode, and the US is now lagging other more developed nations (and US citizens are now barred from non-essential travel to many - all of this winning, I can't take it).

At higher engine speeds the system switches to the short intake runners for greater high rpm power. The result is intake tuning that is optimized for the engine's entire operating range.""

So although there are a lot of identical parts in these two engines, the 2018 TLX does make 21 hp more, which combined with the 8-speed DCT means that it accelerates about half a second faster than a 2016 Accord, even though the Acura weighs a few hundred pounds more.

I keep the car in sport mode, and sometimes when merging or passing get to 6000 rpm or so, which is in the area where the extra power is kicking in, and I can feel it. It's rare, but once in a while I want every one of those 206 horses.
I got 21 more hp. By switching from an 80mm to an 87mm throttle body.

Thanks imid, I like the book seller angle, not so sure about being in a hurricane in Florida. John Grisham writes extremely good books, or incredibly bad books...I only like the ones with 4 or 5 stars.
Don't know if you know the story, Grishams first book was probably his best, A Time to Kill, but it was too good - a literary masterpiece, won awards but didn't sell very well. Grisham went back to the drawing board and checked out best sellers to see what the formula was to write a best seller. He wrote The Firm and he was a huge success.
Thanks for the background info. Interesting. I'll have to see if I read the first book, A Time to Kill. I know I've read The Firm, twice.

And BP is on the list of Top Tier. Krogers in this area many years ago had a connection to Shell and a discount at the Shell stations using Kroger points or something like that. But that changed and disappeared.

I believe our fuel comes from a dump that's adjacent to the Marathon dump not too far from here. I recall many years back the station attendant at Kroger saying their fuel was whatever it said on the truck that delivered it. But I believe the fuels are all the same; additives may be different. But they all originate at the fuel dump about 30 miles or so away. It probably serves many brands.

In the mid 1980s new BMWs were developing driveability issues due to intake valve deposits which were caused by the lack of detergents in US gasoline. BMW NA launched a major program to address the issue, which included walnut shell blasting of the intake valves on affected cars. BMW NA also developed an Intake Valve Deposit test which has been refined into the ASTM D5500 - 20a standard.
All well and good, but the problem today is that on most GDI cars the intake valves never see any fuel, so intake valve deposits have returned. Some early GDI cars had severe IVD issues, but it seems most manufacturers now have it under control. I still run Top Tier 93 octane in everything but the Wrangler.

Another buyback!
Damn straight. It was a $3K piece of audio gear. Watching TV or a movie, about every 10-15 seconds, I’d hear a loud “click” from the receiver and the audio would cut out. 1-2 seconds later, it would come back on. This went on constantly. It was known issue with B&K (after many complaints by the audio community). Bottom line, the company gave short shift to implementing the audio codecs and associated software.

As these things go, it’s one thing to have a problem with a product. It’s quite something else to jack along your customer when you don’t have a fix. It would take me at least 45 minutes to disconnect the receiver and pack it up. I had to drive it to the authorized dealer where I bought it (about 30 minutes away) and they’d pack it up and send it back to the factory to have it fixed. I’d be without the unit for a month. Instead of just sending it back to me, they’d send it to the store where I bought it, and I’d have to go pick it up.

Understand, this thing weighed 45–50 lbs. I’d wrestle it back into my vehicle (luckily, I owned a Tahoe at the time). Get it home and wrestle it back into my audio rack after reconnecting everything. Only to find out, it wasn’t fixed.

I did this 3 times. The last time, I asked the retailer for a refund. They told me they had a 10 day return policy and my issue was with B&K for warranty work as they just sold them. Well, I complained right after I had the thing set up, which was about 2 days after I bought it. They spent another week trying to diagnose it over the phone. By that time, I was past their return policy (I should have just taken it back at the first sign of trouble). They should have interceded with B&K on my behalf, but didn’t. If B&K would have just said, “hey, we’re sorry. We’ve had some issues. Here’s a refund and please come check us out next time”. No harm, no foul. Not what they did, though.


AMEX came through for me when all else failed. I sent them all my service receipts as well as my purchase receipt. I explained they couldn’t fix it (at which time B&K wanted ONE MORE CHANCE to fix it, which I gave them, and they still couldn’t fix it). All of this should sound vaguely familiar to a certain car manufacturer.

I just HATE being taken advantage of.

Over this issue, and all the other customer outcries, B&K went bankrupt about a year after my fiasco with them.

Good advice. I've done that. When my daughter first reported it last Sunday, the first thing I did was tighten the cap. Monday she said it was on, I was hoping a few cycles it would turn off. Later that day I thought I'd take it to have it diagnosed and wait, the light was off. So I filled it up, made sure the cap was tight and all was well. Daughter drove the car several times Tuesday only to tell me the light is back on.
